Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but blood vessels sustain damage when pressure is too high. It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescaleguyton91?. ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion.\nWhen the kidney is not receiving enough salt (which could be a result of a low-salt diet or reduced blood pressure), it initiates a cascade which ends with the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone inducing expression of ENaC in the distal nephron.This whole process is called the “renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system”, or RAAS. It is reviewed well with an eye toward blood pressure inlifton01?."

Apical sodium permeability is increased both by synthesis of new channels as well as trafficking of an existing pool of channels to the cell surface1,2.Of note: Asher and colleagues report an aldosterone-mediated increase in expression of the β and γ, but not α, subunits. A trend of subunit-specific regulation is widely observed in the literature.\n\n\n\n\n1. Asher, C., Wald, H., Rossier, B.C., and Garty, H. (1996).
