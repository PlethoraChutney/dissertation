    "text": "1.1 ENaC in the body\n\n1.1.1 ENaC in the kidney\nBlood pressure must be maintained within a narrow window of acceptable values. Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but too high and blood vessels sustain damage. It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescale1. ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion. Sodium in the principal cells is transported across the basolateral membrane by the Na+/K+ ATPase, and therefore induces retention of extra water to maintain the tightly-controlled plasma sodium level. Thus, ENaC controls three essential functions of kidney filtration: first, the amount of sodium reabsorbed by the kidney; second, blood volume (and therefore pressure); third, the amount of potassium passed from the plasma into the urine.\nA variety of ENaC mutations have dramatic effects on patients’ blood pressure. One of the earliest described is Liddle syndrome2. Liddle syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism) results from an autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation in ENaC. Severe hypertension, low potassium, high blood pH, low renin activity, and low aldosterone are hallmarks of the disease3. It is a rare disorder, with only 72 families described as of 20184. However, after excluding patients with other clear causes (primary aldosteronism, kidney or heart diseases, and obstructive sleep apnea), approximately one in one hundred hypertensive patients had Liddle syndrome, indicating that the prevalence may be higher than is currently thought5,6. All but one of the described cases involve mutation of the β or γ subunits4,6.\nA majority of the mutations in the β and γ subunits disrupt or remove entirely a proline-rich PY motif at the C-terminus of those channels7. This PY motif is the binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (see Section 1.2.2). Study of ENaC surface dwell time is complicated by a reserve pool maintained by the cells to be cycled up to the membrane, but there is a consensus that ENaC is recycled quickly; surface half life estimates range from fifteen minutes to three hours, with the low end having more support8. ENaC lacking the PY motif cannot be pulled back in from the membrane, thus increasing sodium permeability by increasing N rather than the conductivity or PO of the channels9–11. The remaining minority of described Liddle syndrome mutations (including the sole ENaCα mutation) which do not affect PY-motif binding instead directly augment channel PO4. Liddle syndrome is typically treated with small molecules that block ENaC (amiloride or triamterene) and a low-salt diet.The α subunit does have a PY motif, but no Liddle syndrome mutation of the α PY has been described. This is discussed further in .\nLoss-of-function mutations also cause severe phenotypes. Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) was first described in a severely dehydrated infant who did not respond to aldosterone treatment12. There are two forms of PHA1: renal PHA1, which is milder and involves a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor; and systemic PHA1, which involves a mutation in a gene for ENaC α, β, or γ13,14. Patients with systemic PHA1 are unable to retain any salt, and so become severely dehydrated and have high potassium, low sodium, and increased acidity in their blood3. This makes the disease particularly deadly to newborns, and requires life-long supplementation with sodium and the potassium elimination drug Kayexalate15. Contrary to the pattern observed for Liddle Syndrome, most systemic PHA1 mutations occur in the gene encoding ENaCα15. The majority of described PHA1 mutations are nonsense mutations, although three missense mutations have been described14–16. One of these mutations occurs in the palm domain, one in the transmembrane domain, and one likely in the intracellular domain.Although the genes for the β and γ subunits are both on chromosome 16 and the gene for ENaCα is on chromosome 12, no difference in the rates of mutation for the affected genes are seen between patients and control groups15.\n\n\n1.1.2 ENaC in the lung\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disorder which affects many organs, but most prominently the lungs. Patients with CF have thick airway mucus they are unable to clear, causing chronic airway infections and lung damage. Patients with CF also lose salt but, unlike patients with PHA1, the causative mutation is in the CFTR gene rather than an ENaC gene.\nCFTR encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, CFTR17. Pathogenic CFTR mutations dramatically reduce chloride permeability, resulting in poor reabsorption of NaCl18. In the lung, this chloride secretion is balanced by sodium uptake via ENaC, which in turn regulates the thickness of the airway surface liquid (ASL)19. Reduced chloride absorption due to mutant CFTR increases the absorption of sodium. This, in turn, dehydrates and thickens the ASL, which damages the underlying tissue and prevents mucous clearance20,21.\nThe interplay between CFTR and ENaC in CF patients is complicated and not fully understood. Treatment of normal, but not CF, lung epithelia with amiloride augments Cl- transport22. Cells co-expressing CFTR and ENaC show smaller ENaC currents than do cells expressing only ENaC, but this effect depends both CFTR’s ability to pass Cl- and ENaC’s intracellular termini23. Mice which overexpress βENaC in the airway show CF-like symptoms, including reduced airway liquid height and mucous clearance24. It seems, then, that the function of the two ion channels is linked both by electrochemical gradients and potentially other regulatory partners.Interestingly, mice overexpressing the α or γ subunits did not show CF-like symptoms. The authors point to prior research showing that αβ-only channels have a higher PO than αβγ25.\nThe picture turns out not to be quite so neat. Double-mutant mice which overexpress βENaC and CFTR have normal Cl- secretion but neither a concomitant decrease in Na+ absorption nor a rescue of the CF-like phenotype26. Additionally, Liddle syndrome patients have increased sodium absorption throughout their body but neither they nor Liddle syndrome mice develop lung disease27. Human patients with reduced βENaC function develop CF-like phenotypes of lung infection and elevated sweat chloride, but PHA1 patients produce excessive airway liquid without infection28,29. There are many hypothesis as to how these contradictions may be resolved, reviewed well by Collawn and colleagues, but more work on the subject is desperately needed30. One important point is that the mouse model does not recapitulate human disease well. Indeed, mice with CFTR mutations which are pathogenic in humans do not develop lung disease at all31.\n\n\n1.1.3 ENaC in the tongue\nAs one might expect for a sodium-specific ion channel, ENaC is also implicated in taste. Although it may seem a less clinically-essential tissue, ENaC function and expression in the tongue differs significantly from what is expected based on the better-studied kidney. It is therefore useful as a spotlight on how little we still know about the very basic stoichiometry and function of the ENaC subunits.\nThe organization of taste in the mammalian tongue is complex, but well-reviewed by Yarmolinsnky and colleagues32. Briefly, taste buds comprise 50–100 taste receptor cells (TRCs). Each TRC expresses receptors for and responds to just one of the five basic tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami33,34. These receptors are highly diverse, with closely-related species having widely varying taste responses to the same molecule.For instance, hamsters do not taste aspartame as sweet35.\nSalt sensation is further divided into an appetitive taste (a potato chip) and an aversive taste (sea water). Amiloride blocks rats’ ability to taste the difference between KCl and NaCl and reduces their voluntary NaCl (but not KCl) consumption36,37. Thus, the appetitive taste is taken to result from Na+ currents in amiloride-sensitive TRCs, while the aversive NaCl taste results from Cl- currents in amiloride-insensitive TRCs38. ENaC seems a prime candidate for the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current; indeed all three subunits are detected in taste buds but not the surrounding epithelia39. Mice with αENaC specifically knocked-out in mature TRCs lost their preference for salt, and those TRCs no longer responded to low Na+ concentrations40. However, recent work has significantly complicated the role of αβγ ENaC in salt taste.\nInvestigation of ENaC expression patterns in mouse taste buds show that no taste bud cell expresses both the α and β subunits41. This result is further complicated by the fact that amiloride-sensitive salt perception depends on the mouse line, and the line used in the expression pattern study has a low amiloride sensitivity42. Thus the possibility remains that salt taste in mice is mediated by αβγENaC and is simply harder to detect with this experimental setup. However, as discussed further in section , αENaC is sufficient to form small (100 times smaller than αβγ) currents when expressed alone in oocytes43. Homomeric α channels may instead carry the amiloride-sensitive salt taste. Perhaps more importantly, salt taste in humans is insensitive to amiloride44. Additionally, humans express δENaC (a fourth subunit which is a pseudogene in rats and mice) in the taste bud, rather than αENaC45.\nThe mouse model of taste, much like that of cystic fibrosis, seems to be a poor facsimile of the process in humans. Despite this fact, salty taste illustrates an important unanswered question regarding ENaC: what is the full compliment of physiologically-relevant functional ENaC channels? As covered in , the two canonical channels comprise one each of the β, γ, and either α or δ subunits. However, the combination of αENaC knock-out mice and ENaC expression patterns makes it apparent that channels with only a single ENaC subunit, while rare, are physiologically relevant. I note here that we cannot say these channels are homomeric αENaC channels. They may be assemblies of ENaC with other ENaC/DEG family members or as-yet unknown other proteins. Regardless of the ultimate identity of the amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor, the patterns observed in taste are difficult to explain if the only physiologically relevant ENaC is the α/δβγ triheteromer, which makes it an interesting and valuable system for further study.\n\n\n1.1.4 ENaC in blood vessels\nMyogenic vasoconstriction is an important component of blood pressure regulation in which the diameter of a blood vessel decreases in response to increased blood pressure. This response is essential for maintaining proper blood flow. ENaC is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells responsible for the constriction of blood vessels46,47. Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives reduces myogenic tone in a dose-dependent manner. This fact, combined with the knowledge that ENaC relatives are mechanosensitive in worms makes ENaC a likely candidate for the pressure sensor responsible for myogenic vasoconstriction48.Not to belabor an earlier point, but only β and γ ENaC are detected in ex vivo preparations of vascular smooth muscle cells, while those subunits plus α are detected in cultured cells.\nSimilarly, systemic blood pressure is monitored by the central nervous system via baroreceptors. Baroreceptors keep mean arterial pressure at a steady level on a short time scale49. These neurons express β and γ, but not α, ENaC50. Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives blocks both the response of these neurons to physical stimulation and blood pressure regulation. It therefore seems likely that ENaC is used by baroreceptors to sense blood pressure, but further research is necessary to strictly define this role.\n\n\n1.1.5 ENaC in the colon\nENaC plays an important role in sodium reabsorption in the colon. Colon expression of the β and γ, but not α, subunits increases in response to aldosterone treatment51,52. Patients with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowl disease, have reduced sodium reabsorption in the colon, which leads to diarrhea53,54. Similarly, patients with ulcerative colitis have diarrhea due to inhibition of ENaC expression by inflammatory cytokines55. To be clear, the colon relies on a wide array of systems to reabsorb ions and water. These results indicate that ENaC is one of the players in this process."

    "text": "1.2 Regulation\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Simplified model of ENaC regulation in a principal cell of the distal nephron in the kidney.\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise that expression of ENaC is under tight control, given the number of important processes ENaC is implicated in. This overview of ENaC regulation is necessarily brief and focuses on regulation in the kidney (Figure 1.1), since that system is best understood. Fortunately, the patterns observed in the kidney largely hold in other tissues.\n\n1.2.1 Aldosterone\nWhen the kidney is not receiving enough salt, it initiates a cascade to increase activity of ENaC via the hormone aldosterone. Aldosterone is therefore the main hormonal control over sodium homeostasis. Aldosterone response is divided into two phases, aptly named the early and late phases. Aldosterone increases ENaC PO in part via increased activity of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK, Section 1.2.3)58,59. SGK both directly regulates ENaC PO and the ability of Nedd4-2 to mark ENaC for degradation60,61. Aldosterone also stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), which increases ENaC PO62. For a review of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System (RAAS) consider Weir and Dzau56. For a review more focused on aldosterone alone, Stockand’s is quite thorough and readable57.\nAldosterone’s late phase increase of sodium permeability is mediated both by direct increase of ENaC gene expression and movement of ENaC from an internal pool to the apical membrane63–66. In some studies, aldosterone increases transcription of the β- and γ- (but not α-) ENaC genes63,67–69. In others, increases in αENaC transcription are also (or exclusively) observed66,70–73. The effect of aldosterone does seem to be consistent within tissue types: most studies demonstrating an increase in αENaC transcription are performed in the kidney, while aldosterone increases β and γ transcription in the colon. ENaC transcription in the lung is less dependent on circulating aldosterone levels than other tissues74.\n\n\n1.2.2 Nedd4-2\nNedd4-2, also known as Nedd4L, is a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ligases perform the final step in the ubiquitination cascade: the transfer of an activated ubiquitin (Ub) from an E2 to the substrate. Nedd4-2 is the cognate E3 ligase for ENaC in humans, rats, and mice (but not Xenopus). Ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4-2 results in internalization and degradation of the channel, reducing the cell’s Na+ permeability. Disruption of this mechanism is the most common cause of Liddle syndrome (Section 1.1.1), indicating the essential role Nedd4-2 plays in regulation of ENaC surface expression.In older literature, this process is called “Sodium Feedback Inhibition”.\n\n1.2.2.1 Nedd4-2 Structure\nLike many members of the HECT ligase family, Nedd4-2 has an N-terminal C2 domain, three or four (depending on the species) WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain. As the astute reader has already guessed, humans also express a closely-related HECT E3 ligase, Nedd4, which does not regulate ENaC in vivo75,76. It is important to note that expressing either of these two ligases heterologously does inhibit ENaC. This makes evaluation of the Nedd4-2/ENaC literature complicated, as conclusions drawn from heterologous systems may not hold in the organism. In any case, the two proteins are 63% identical, and although there are differences in substrate affinity, the function of the domains in an abstract sense is quite similar. As such, I will present research on both proteins, preferring results from Nedd4-2 when possible, and highlighting points where the findings may not be fully generalizable.\nThe C2 domain is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid and protein binding domain. Increased intracellular Ca2+ induces translocation of Nedd4 from the cytosol to the membrane78. Interestingly, the Nedd4-2 C2 domain specifically localizes the protein to the apical membrane (to which ENaC also localizes). This apical targeting is the result of an interaction between the C2 domain and Annexin XIIIb79.For a good review of general C2 domain evolution, structure, and function see Rizo and Südhof77.\nWW domains are protein-protein interaction domains comprising a three-stranded β-sheet. These small domains bind PY-motifs (PPXY), including those found in each ENaC subunit (PPAY, PPNY, PPKY in human α, β, and γ respectively). It is the removal of these domains that causes Liddle syndrome in truncation mutants80. Nedd4-2 cannot bind the Liddle mutants, and so the cell cannot pull the open channels from the surface, resulting in a gain of function. Interestingly, mice and rat Nedd4-2 have three WW domains, while human Nedd4-2 has four.\nThe HECT domain is the business end of the protein. Unlike RING ligases, HECT ligases form a thioester bond with Ub before transferring it to the substrate. The domain itself is split into the N-lobe, which is larger and interacts with the E2 enzyme, and the C-lobe, which contains the catalytic cysteine.Buetow and Huang’s review of E3 ligase structure is very good, and includes HECT ligases81.\nHECT ligases have several auto-inhibitory functions to prevent inappropriate ubiquitination. The C2 domain of a related HECT ligase intramolecularly binds the HECT domain near the catalytic cysteine, blocking function56. The HECT domain also has an internal PY motif which is bound by its own WW domain82. Nedd4-2 remains bound this way until it encounters a substrate, at which point it binds and ubiquitinates the target. The enzyme then ubiquitinates itself, targeting it for degradation. Finally, the linker between WW domains 2 and 3 blocks function of the HECT domain in Nedd483.It is not currently known which WW domain binds this internal PY motif, or if the association is intra- or intermolecular.\n\n\n1.2.2.2 Nedd4-2 and ENaC\nNedd4-2 is expressed throughout the body, but is most abundant in the kidney and lung84. In a high-salt binds and ubiquitinates ENaC, causing the channels to be internalized and degraded60,85–87. The functional importance of lipid binding by the C2 domain for this role is unclear. In heterologous systems, both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are able to inhibit ENaC currents with or without a C2 domain, and both rats and humans express splice variants of Nedd4-2 which is missing the C2 domain88–91. In fact, C2-less Nedd4 suppresses ENaC currents more than WT Nedd4 in heterologous systems88,92. Many heterologous studies in which Nedd4 inhibits ENaC were performed with a C2-less isoform, further indicating that it may be the C2 inhibition of the HECT domain that prevents ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4. However, mice expressing Nedd4-2 without a C2 domain fail to regulate ENaC in response to a high-salt diet and develop hypertension, leaving open the possibility that the membrane-binding functionality is more important in vivo93.\nNedd4-2 relies on a subset of its WW domains to bind and regulate ENaC. In humans, only WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4-2 are required to reduce ENaC currents94. Human WW2 does bind ENaC weakly, while WW1 does not seem to interact with any ENaC subunit. Differential affinity among the WW domains is observed in other species as well88,95.Nedd4-2 does regulate many other proteins — it is possible that WW1 is required to regulate these other targets.\nOnce ENaC is bound, the HECT domain begins ubiquitinating N-terminal lysines on the channel87. Although lysines in each subunit are ubiquitinated, the γ subunit lysines are required for ubiquitination of α and β. HECT domains are capable of serial ubiquitin addition, building long chains of ubiquitin by connecting the C-terminus of the new ubiquitin to the N-terminus or a lysine on the growing chain96. Different chains determine the ultimate fate of the tagged protein; Nedd4-2 preferentially produces chains of ubiquitin connected by lysine 63 (K63 chains)97. K63 chains most often send substrates somewhere other than the proteasome for degradation or recycling. In the specific case of ENaC, some groups have reported lysosomal degradation, while others report a combination of proteasomal and lysosomal targeting86,87,99.For a review of the roles different ubiquitin chains play, I recommend Komander and Rape98.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 SGK\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "section": "A.2 ENaC Purification",
    "text": "A.2 ENaC Purification\n\nA.2.1 Human ENaC\nThroughout this protocol, quantities of resin and buffer are given “per flask”. I grow cell culture in quantities of 800 mL culture per flask, meaning that, e.g., pelleted cells from 1.6 L of cells require twice the quoted quantities of buffer and resin. In datasets with NaCl listed as the salt, solubilization buffer, wash buffers, elution buffer, and SEC buffer used NaCl in place of KCl.\nTo purify ENaC, frozen whole-cell pellets were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed in a 37 °C water bath. While the pellets were thawing, 50 mL Solubilization Buffer was prepared per flask:\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl\n1 tablet per 100 mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n25 U/mL ThermoFisher universal nuclease\n2.5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2\n10 mg/mL digitonin\n10 μM amiloride\n\nThe solubilization buffer was prepared fresh at 2x concentration (i.e., half the final volume). Once pellets were fully thawed, they were added to the solubilization buffer and the mixture was brought to the final volume with DI water and poured into a screw-cap bottle. The solubilization mixture was left at 8 °C for 1.5 hours.\nAfter solubilization was complete, the crude lysate was decanted into ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 45 minutes at 4 °C.  Meanwhile, in-house-made GFP-nanobody CNBr resin (0.8 mL per flask) was loaded into an XK 16 column and washed with 2 CV of TBK\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n\nand the following buffers were prepared in the listed quantities:\nwash A (10 column volumes [CV]):\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 mM MgCl2\n2 mM ATP\n2 nM phenamil\n\nwash B (10 CV):\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n5 mM CaCl2\n2 nM phenamil;\n\nelution buffer (5 CV): wash B with 33 μg/mL thrombin\nThe column was washed with 2 CV of wash A, then clarified lysate was bound to the column under 4 mL/min flow. A small aliquot of pre-column and post-column clarified lysate was reserved to assess binding efficiency by GFP FSEC1. If binding efficiency fell below 90% of the initial efficiency the resin was discarded. Otherwise, it was regenerated with pulsed pH cleaning. The GFP-nanobody column was washed with 5 CV wash A and B.\nTo elute ENaC from the GFP nanobody resin, the column was washed 3 times with 1.5 CV elution buffer and once with TBK with 0.7 mg/mL digitonin. As each wash was flowed on, the eluant was collected in 1 mL or 0.25 CV fractions, whichever was smaller. This results in four sets of fractions: the first comprises largely wash B with little protein (from the initial flow-on of elution buffer), and the remaining three elution buffer. All fractions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and fractions with bands at the expected molecular weight for ENaC were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 mL. If the preparation was acid-shocked, the protein was desalted into acid shock buffer at this stage:\n\n20 mM Tris pH 6\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 nM phenamil\n\nIf the preparation required Fabs, they were added in two-fold excess of protein concentration (as determined by nanodrop A280) at this stage. A final concentration of 1 mM C8 PIP2 was added to the CKO/DEG monofab samples just before grid preparation.\nThe concentrated eluant was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in SEC buffer for further purification via SEC.\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 nM phenamil\n\nSEC was typically run overnight, meaning fractions remained at 4 °C until the next morning. Fractions from the SEC peak were collected and assayed for purity and monodispersity by SDS-PAGE and tryptophan FSEC. Monodisperse peaks were pooled and used the same day. Thus, total time between cell pellet thaw and protein use was typically less than 36 hours.\n\n\nA.2.2 Mouse ENaC\nFrozen cell pellet was thawed on ice. Membranes were prepared by sonication and centrifugation, then re-frozen until purification. For each gram of membranes, 15 mL of solubilization buffer was added\n\n4 mM GDN\n20 mM HEPES pH 7.6\n150 mM NaCl\n2 mM ATP\n2 mM MgSO4\n1 mM TCEP\n100 μM amiloride\n1 tablet per 100 mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n\nMembrane pellet was mixed thoroughly and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer.

The lipid film was left overnight in a vacuum desiccator to remove all chloroform. The lipids were then resuspended in 350 μL reconstitution buffer\n\n20 mM HEPES pH 7.4\n100 mM KCl\n1 mM EDTA\n\nand sonicated until the solution was milky in appearance and no lipids remained adhered to the sides of the tube, typically 5–10 minutes. To this solution, 150 μL of 350 μM DM in reconstitution buffer was added. The resulting 500 μL suspension was sonicated in 5 minute bursts until completely clear. To this suspension, 1 mL TBS was added to prepare a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/mL.\nLipids, ENaC, and MSP2N2 were mixed at a final MSP:POPC:ENaC molar ratio of 1:31:0.04. The final concentration of MSP2N2 was kept at 100 μM by further concentrating ENaC or adding lipid reconstitution buffer with 35 mM DM as necessary. This reconstitution mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. During this incubation, biobeads were washed once in 100% methanol, three times in water, and once in TBS. After 90 minutes, 215 mg washed biobeads per 1 mL reconstitution mixture were added. After 1 hour, the reconstitution mixture was moved to a fresh aliquot of equilibrated biobeads and left nutating overnight at room temperature, approximately 16 hours. The reconstitution mixture was pipetted off the biobeads, filtered with a 0.2 μm filter, and purified via SEC using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column in TBS. Typical yields were extremely low, between 5–10% of input ENaC. The protein assembly was stable with minimal aggregation at 4 °C (assessed by cryoEM and SEC) for at least two weeks."

Purified GFP-cleaved ENaC was concentrated for grid preparation just before blotting and freezing. All grids were glow discharged at 15 mA for 60 seconds on a Pelco easiGlow before blotting. Grids were frozen using a Vitrobot Mark III (Thermo Fisher). Vitrobot parameters were set as follows: blot time 2, wait time 0, drain time 0, blot force 1, humidity 100%, temperature 12 °C. “Double-blotted” grids had a protein droplet loaded, manually blotted with torn Whatman filter paper, and a fresh droplet loaded onto the grid before Vitrobot blotting (with Vitrobot filter paper rings) and freezing. This double-blotting process typically took approximately five seconds from first drop to plunge-freeze. In all cases, each protein droplet was 3 μL.\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: Fab binding induces only minor changes in the extracellular domain of ENaC. A: Human CKO/DEG map. A low-pass filtered map is outlined to show pseudosymmetry-breaking glycosylation sites (arrows). B: the α subunit, C: the β subunit. Human CKO nanodisc model is colored by subunit, the human CKO/DEG ENaC is white, and human CKO/DEG Fabs are grey.\n\n\nMost datasets were collected with at least one of our two pseudosymmetry-breaking Fabs, developed previously2. I have switched from using both Fabs to only using one, because the β-binding Fab is more flexible than the α-binding Fab, and this flexibility reduces overall alignment property. Additionally, one of the two human CKO datasets was first incorporated into nanodiscs and solved without any Fabs. As expected based on our previous studies of electrophysiology of the Fab-bound channels, our ECD models with and without Fab are largely indistinguishable (Figure A.1 B,C)3. Neither fab significantly distorts the surrounding ECD environment when bound. The α-binding Fab induces a slight shift in a region near the β-ball, while the β-binding Fab induces no detectable change at all."

    "text": "A.7 cryoEM Image Processing\nEach dataset was processed slightly differently, but following the same general pipeline. First, movies were imported into cryoSPARC for pre-processing. Default parameters were used for both motion correction and CTF estimation. Next, particles were picked using the blob picker in cryoSPARC. Adjustments were made to the minimum and maximum radii to account for the number of Fabs present in each sample. Blob picks for several micrographs were manually inspected and adjusted. First, the NCC parameter was adjusted until few contaminant and carbon-edge picks remained. Next, in a low-defocus micrograph, the low power threshold was adjusted to remove empty ice picks. Finally, in a high-defocus micrograph, the high power threshold was adjusted to remove all carbon-edge and contaminant picks. These initial blob picks were cleaned by 2D classification, and the resulting particle sets used to generate templates for template picking. Template picked thresholds were adjusted as for blob picked particles.\nThe template picked particles were repeatedly 3D classified using heterogeneous refinement in cryoSPARC, providing one “good” class and a number of “junk” classes (typically noisy or bad ab initio models of the blob picked particles) until all particles produced reasonable ENaC classes. The final particle set was never 2D classified, since I find that 2D classification reduces the frequency of rare particle views. From this point, processing proceeded ad hoc to produce the final maps (Image Processing).\n\n\n\nFigure A.2: S2C2 pixel sizes seem miscalibrated. A: Scaling the nominal pixel size for human CKO/DEG dramatically increases the correlation with human CKO digitonin. B: Correlation coefficients for all maps. Maps were aligned prior to taking correlation coefficients. Abbreviated as follows: hCKO: human CKO; hCD-MF: human CKO/DEG monofab; mTrypsin: trypsin-cleaved mouse; hCKO/DEG: human CKO/DEG difab; hCKO-ND: human CKO nanodisc; mUncleaved: mouse uncleaved; mJanelia2: a second uncleaved mouse dataset collected at Janelia, but not presented here.\n\n\nDuring image processing, I began to suspect that the pixel sizes provided by S2C2 are likely miscalibrated. First, other users reported pixel size calibration issues with S2C2 microscopes around the time these datasets were collected (Patrick Mitchell, S2C2 Director of Operations, personal communication). Second, scaling the CKO/DEG difab pixel size from the nominally-correct 0.43 to 0.414 (a change of approximately 3.6%) changes the map correlation value from 0.72 to 0.93 (Figure A.2 A). Finally, a comparison of the correlation between seven recently-collected ENaC maps shows that S2C2 is an outlier, with unscaled maps generated from data collected at PNCC and Janelia Farm correlating better with themselves and each other than with those collected at S2C2 regardless of construct (Figure A.2 B). I therefore decided to scale both S2C2 maps to correlate best with the same condition and construct recorded at PNCC after processing was complete. I present the models built into the scaled maps in this work."

    "text": "A.8 Model Building\nThe starting model for mouse ENaC was generated using a local installation of AlphaFold5. The amino acid sequences for mENaC α (Uniprot ID Q61180), β (Uniprot ID Q9WU38), and γ (Uniprot ID Q9WU39) were joined using 10xGS linkers between α and β, and β and γ. This meta-sequence was then entered as the AlphaFold target. The linkers and large, unstructured, low-confidence loops were removed from the model before proceeding.\nBefore docking into experimental maps, starting models had Fabs and waters deleted to ease early model building steps. Initial models were rigid-body fitted into the experimental maps. Any loops in poor or missing regions of the map were deleted. The whole models were simulated with distance restraints using ISOLDE and ChimeraX6,7. Once models were roughly fit into the potential, strained distance restraints were released. Once the backbone appeared to fit reasonably well into the map, all distance restraints were released. Simulating one chain at a time, a pass over every residue in ENaC was performed, focusing on Ramachandran values and rotamers. Once all chains had been optimized in this manner, glycans were added using Coot’s carbohydrate module8. Fabs were rigid-body fitted and simulated similarly to the initial models once these steps were complete.\nModels were refined using Phenix real-space refinement9. In some cases, the TMD map was used as-is for refinement. In other cases, the ECD and TMD map were combined using Phenix’s “Combine Focused Maps” job and the resulting map was used for refinement. In these cases, the lowest GSFSC resolution was provided to Phenix. Parameters were left as default, except rotamers were only refined when they had both poor map quality and were outliers (rather than or). I changed this setting because rotamer and clash statistics were significantly worse if it was left as the default. Model quality was assessed using MolProbity within Phenix, Q-scores calculated in ChimeraX, and 3DFSC as implemented in cryoSPARC (Table A.1 and Appendix C)10–12."

All human channels in this work have mutant furin sites (αR178A R204A and γR138A). Additionally, all human channels are “cysteine knock-out” (CKO) mutants, with the following mutations: αC63A, βC30A, and γC33A C41A. Some (but not all) cysteines in the ENaC TMD are known to be palmitoylated13–15. CKO channels express at approximately eight times the yield of wild-type-like channels, with similar electrophysiological traits (Figure A.3). Mouse channels presented in this work have no mutations from the consensus gene. I expect mouse and CKO channels to be closed.\n\n\n\nFigure A.3: I/V curves for human CKO and CKO/DEG channels. Values are normalized per-cell to the inward current at -80 mV before trypsin treatment. Cells were treated with trypsin for five minutes before being re-recorded. Each point is the average of three cells. Error bars represent +/- one standard deviation.\n\n\nDEG channels have two mutations: βS520K and αT240W. The former mutation at what has been named the “DEG site” holds the channel in an open state regardless of proteolytic cleavage state16. The DEG site sits in the TMD just above the predicted amiloride-binding site. The latter mutation in α lies in the GRIP domain and also increases the PO of uncleaved ENaC17."

Cells were incubated at 37 °C overnight with 1 μM amiloride. Cells were then pipetted over a dish of DMEM with 10% FBS with several small coverslips and allowed to adhere at 37 °C while the electrophysiology rig was prepared, approximately 2 hours.

Each salt solution also had a counterpart with 100 μM amiloride added. Finally, a trypsin solution (KCl external solution with 5 μg/mL trypsin) was prepared.\nAmiloride sensitive current was determined by placing a cell in the amiloride external solution for 1 second, the amiloride-free solution for 2 seconds, and returning to the amiloride solution for 1 second. Average current during no-amiloride traces was subtracted to set the baseline to 0 A, and the maximum current during the 2 second no-amiloride duration taken as the amiloride-sensitive current. The K+ recordings show a current spike when returning to the amiloride-containing solution, which I exclude from the calculations. This process was performed once for each holding potential between -80 and +80 mV, stepping by 20 mV. Then, this entire voltage sweep was repeated for each of the two remaining salts. The cell was then exposed to the trypsin solution for 5 minutes, and the entire set of voltage and salt sweeps repeated for the post-trypsin measurements. Thus, the full combination of voltage, salt, and proteolytic cleavage states was recorded on each cell. Once a dish had been exposed to the trypsin solution, the dish was replaced with a fresh dish and coverslip to prevent early cleavage of unmeasured cells.\n\n\n\n\n1. Kawate, T., and Gouaux, E.

    "section": "D.1 Appia",
    "text": "D.1 Appia\nModern structural biology makes extensive use of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The two types of SEC I encountered most often were analytic chromatography, in which samples are assessed for monodispersity and relative amount; and preparative chromatography, in which samples are purified based on their size. In an environment where only a heuristic assessment of these parameters is important (e.g., assessing whether a sample is homogeneous enough to make grids of, or whether a protein interacts with another) these parameters can be assessed by eye (Figure D.1). However, chromatography instrument manufacturers must include capacity for more complex analyses in their software. This necessarily makes the software more complex and arcane in the service of features that biochemists rarely need. To solve this mismatch I created Appia, a web-based chromatography visualization package1. In this section I will provide a brief summery of Appia’s functionality and intended use, the installation process, and then some guidance for adding support for new chromatography instruments.Appia can be installed via pip, or the source can be inspected at my github.\n\n\n\nFigure D.1: Heuristic chromatography parameters are easily assessed by eye. Users can approximate affinity for the stationary phase (size, in the case of SEC), quantity, homogeneity, and the number of distinct species by inspecting peak shifts, peak height, peak width, and number of peaks respectively.\n\n\n\nD.1.1 Structure\nAppia is divided into two conceptual parts: the local processor and the web interface. The local processor is written entirely in python and processes all supported data formats into a unified Appia experiment. Several options are available at processing time, such as applying a scaling factor for various manufacturers or automatic trace plotting. Additionally, the local processor includes a user settings system. This system stores information such as flow rates to apply to a specific chromatography method and database login information. Experiments, to Appia, are collections of analytic and preparative traces. Importantly, Appia is agnostic as to the origins of the data in a single experiment — experiments may contain traces from any number of manufacturers and/or instruments, provided Appia has a processor for that manufacturer. The experiments are stored on the local machine in both long (appropriate for ggplot2 and other grammar-of-graphics plotting systems) and wide (appropriate for, e.g., Excel or Prism) formats (Figure D.2). These experiments are packaged with an experiment ID and uploaded to the other half of Appia, Appia Web.\n\n\n\nFigure D.2: Data formats saved by Appia and available for user download. Traces made up of individual samples (A) are represented as a single row in the long format (B). The wide format (C) instead represents the independent variable with its own column (Time, red), the response variable with the table body (Signal, white), and all other variables in column headers (various colors).\n\n\nAppia Web provides a browser-based GUI and centralized trace database. The database is a CouchDB database containing a simple dictionary of experiments stored under their experiment IDs. The browser-based GUI is written in python and plotly dash, and loads user-requested data from the database and presents it using a series of line plots. Analytic data is presented with one line per sample per channel, while preparative data is presented as a single line per injection with fractions highlighted by fill. Analytic data is also presented with a normalization applied, such that the maximum of each trace is 1 and the minimum is 0. The user may select a region of the analytic traces and re-normalize them to set the maximum over that range to 1, scaling the rest of the trace linearly (Figure D.3). This normalization process is intended to aid in comparison of relative peak heights between different samples which may have a different total amount of material, or to compare peaks within a trace compared to some standard peak height. Importantly, this process uses the simple readout of peak height. More complex analyses or analyses requiring quantitative accuracy are outside the scope of Appia and should use manufacturer-provided peak calling and fitting. Users can also download images and raw data from Appia Web.\n\n\n\nFigure D.3: Appia’s normalization process. A user-selected region is used to linearly scale all traces such that their maximum value over that region is 1.\n\n\n\n\nD.1.2 Installation\nAppia can be used solely to locally process chromatography data into a standard format for later plotting. However, we recommend installing a processing installation on each instrument computer and a single centralized Appia Web installation on some networked computer. This allows for single-click processing and upload of data to a central repository which users can then inspect, manipulate, and download from their personal computers without installing Appia. To facilitate this process, I have created Docker images for Appia Web. Images are available for both x86-64 and ARM architectures, and docker-compose templates are available in the project repository. Running one of these templates creates and networks the database and Appia Web automatically, requiring only that the user expose the correct ports (5984 for CouchDB and 8080 for Appia Web).\nBelow is an example process for installing Appia Web on a Windows PC which is accessible at example.ohsu.edu:\n\nInstall docker desktop\nDownload install-appia-web_pc.ps1 and run it. Provide the desired configuration information\nRun docker-compose up -d\nEnsure that ports 5984 (database) and 8080 (web interface) are accessible\n\nThe Appia Web interface would now be available at example.ohsu.edu:8080/traces. All that is left is installing the processor on the instrument computer, a much simpler process:\n\nInstall python\nRun python -m pip install appia\nRun appia utils --database-setup and provide the information set up during Appia Web installation.\n\nNow when a user finishes a chromatography experiment, they first export it to whatever format Appia expects (typically the default text format) and run (assuming the files end in .txt) appia process *.txt -d to upload the data to the web interface. The files will automatically be organized and stored on the local computer as well. This command can be wrapped in a script to avoid the need for users to interact with the command line.\n\n\nD.1.3 Writing a new processor\nThis section is intended for the advanced reader who wishes to add support for a chromatography instrument to Appia.\nProcessors are each a class which inherits from either HplcProcessor or FplcProcessor (for analytic or preparative data, respectively). At the time of writing, Appia supports the following data formats:\n\nWaters Empower .arw files\nShimadzu .asc files\nShimadzu .txt files\nAgilent .csv files\nCytiva/GE .csv files\n\nYour processor can perform any necessary setup in __init__(), but it must eventually run\nsuper().__init__(\n    filename,\n    manufacturer = {appropriate_string},\n    **kwargs\n)\nWhen Appia processes files, for each file, it creates an instance of every Processor child. These Processors all decide whether they can process a file using their claim_file() method, which you must implement. This method should accept a filename and return True if the processor thinks that is a type of file it can process and False otherwise. For instance, here is WatersProcessor.claim_file():\n@classmethod\ndef claim_file(cls, filename) -&gt; bool:\n    return filename[-4:].lower() == '.arw'\nIt simply checks whether the file ends in .arw. Depending on the data format for the new manufacturer, the method may require more complex checks, or you may have to add more specificity to other claim_file() methods.\nIf your processor claims the file, it will automatically run two methods: prepare_sample() and process_file(). The distinction between these is arbitrary, as they are both always run in sequence. It is intended that prepare_sample() collects metadata about the sample (method name, flow rate, sample set name, etc.) and process_file() creates the actual data frame. The data frame must be in the long format, should be stored in your processor’s df attribute, and should have exactly the following column names:\n\nmL: the retention volume in mL.\nTime: the retention time in minutes.\nSample: the sample name.\nChannel: the signal channel. Values in this column are arbitrary but should follow some kind of internal logic.\nNormalization: whether this row is normalized (“Normalized”) or raw (“Signal”).\nValue: the y-axis position for this row.\n\nAt this point, your Processor is done. As long as only one Processor claimed a file, the Appia parser will handle concatenation, plotting, and upload for you.I would encourage you to write a test as well, of course.\nThe parent classes provide a few conveniences for you. For example, the flow_rate and column_volume getters will prompt the user for the relevant info, if necessary, and then offer to store it in the user settings. It will also handle overrides of various parameters, which are accepted through kwargs. Additionally, appia.processors.core provides the normalize() function, which handles trace normalization. I encourage you to take a look at the Processors I’ve already written before embarking on writing your own."

    "text": "D.2 Model-building tools\nI’ve written a few tools to aid with model building and general structure analysis. They’re all available on my github.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.4: An image from ca_bilder.py highlighting the movement of the finger and thumb between the resting and desensitized states of ASIC1.\n\n\nca_bilder.py creates a .bild file visualizing Cα shifts between two given models. Cylinders are drawn between each pair of Cα atoms, colored by the distance. The colors are scaled per-model, with the darkest color corresponding to the greatest shift. The models must be aligned before they are run through the script. If the models are multi-chain, cylinders will be drawn between the same chain ID. If the models are of two different proteins, you must provide a FASTA alignment and indicate which chain belongs to which sequence. These visualizations can be useful to highlight when certain domains move while others stay still, such as ASIC1’s gating cycle (Figure D.4).\ncheck_for_glyc.py searches a PDB model for the sequence NXS/T, the canonical N-linked glycosylation sequence. All asparagines matching this requirement are added to a ChimeraX command HTML file. Opening this file with ChimeraX creates a list of clickable asparagine names. Clicking these links orients the camera on the appropriate residue and removes the link from the list, creating a checklist of sorts. If the model and map are both open, this is a convenient way to step through all potential glycosylation sites in a model and assess whether they are indeed glycosylated. The user may then add sugars via the normal commands.\nmodel_map.py, orientation_plotter.py, phenix-table-reader.py, and the three R scripts all read information from PHENIX or 3DFSC output and produce more aesthetically appealing plots. phenix-table-reader.py is a convenient way to automatically update a Table 1 (for instance, Table A.1) during the model building process. Output from the other scripts can be seen in Appendix C.\nmutator.py checks the sequence of a model against a FASTA sequence and alerts the user to any mismatches. It also creates a ChimeraX command file which can be run to mutate the model to match the FASTA file. Any known deviations can be passed to the script as a .txt file with one mutation per line in a ChimeraX-like format. For instance, if chain A has a C→K mutation at position 260, the .txt file should have a line reading /A:C260K.\ntranslator.py is currently ENaC specific, but could be generalized by a user. It is a simple script to translate residue numbers between the same gene of different organisms using a FASTA file. It is mostly useful when reading or writing and trying to incorporate data from multiple organisms. An example of this script in use:\n$ translator.py mA260\nMouse αK260 =&gt; Human αK233\nAt time of writing, PHENIX adds waters to a seemingly random chain (perhaps based on proximity?) and with a number overlapping other residue numbers. This makes analysis extremely frustrating, since waters have the exact same atom specifier as other residues and are spread over the chains. water_fixer.py solves this problem by reading through a PDB file and moving all waters to chain H and numbering them starting at 1. This has the unfortunate side effect of waters not being numbered in a spatially coherent way, but it’s better than nothing.\n\n\n\n\n1. Posert, R., and Baconguis, I. (2023).
