    "section": "1.1 ENaC in the body",
    "text": "1.1 ENaC in the body\n\n1.1.1 ENaC in the kidney\nBlood pressure must be maintained within a narrow window of acceptable values. Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but too high and blood vessels sustain damage. It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescale1. ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion. Sodium in the principal cells is transported across the basolateral membrane by the Na+/K+ ATPase, and therefore induces retention of extra water to maintain the tightly-controlled plasma sodium level. Thus, ENaC controls three essential functions of kidney filtration: first, the amount of sodium reabsorbed by the kidney; second, blood volume (and therefore pressure); third, the amount of potassium passed from the plasma into the urine.\nA variety of ENaC mutations have dramatic effects on patients’ blood pressure. One of the earliest described is Liddle syndrome2. Liddle syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism) results from an autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation in ENaC. Severe hypertension, low potassium, high blood pH, low renin activity, and low aldosterone are hallmarks of the disease3. It is a rare disorder, with only 72 families described as of 20184. However, after excluding patients with other clear causes (primary aldosteronism, kidney or heart diseases, and obstructive sleep apnea), approximately one in one hundred hypertensive patients had Liddle syndrome, indicating that the prevalence may be higher than is currently thought5,6. All but one of the described cases involve mutation of the β or γ subunits4,6.\nA majority of the mutations in the β and γ subunits disrupt or remove entirely a proline-rich PY motif at the C-terminus of those channels7. This PY motif is the binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 (see Section 1.2.2). Study of ENaC surface dwell time is complicated by a reserve pool maintained by the cells to be cycled up to the membrane, but there is a consensus that ENaC is recycled quickly; surface half life estimates range from fifteen minutes to three hours, with the low end having more support8. ENaC lacking the PY motif cannot be pulled back in from the membrane, thus increasing sodium permeability by increasing N rather than the conductivity or PO of the channels9–11. The remaining minority of described Liddle syndrome mutations (including the sole ENaCα mutation) which do not affect PY-motif binding instead directly augment channel PO4. Liddle syndrome is typically treated with small molecules that block ENaC (amiloride or triamterene) and a low-salt diet.The α subunit does have a PY motif, but no Liddle syndrome mutation of the α PY has been described. This is discussed further in Section 1.2.2.2.\nMouse models of Liddle syndrome complicate the situation somewhat. Mice with homozygous mutant Liddle βENaC fed a normal salt diet do not develop the characteristic high blood pressure, low potassium, and acidosis as humans do12. Instead, these phenotypes only develop with a high-salt diet. Moreover, these mice are still able to retrieve ENaC from the cell surface in the colon (unlike human Liddle patients)13. It is thus not clear that the mouse model of Liddle syndrome is fully applicable to the human disease.\nLoss-of-function mutations also cause severe phenotypes. Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) was first described in a severely dehydrated infant who did not respond to aldosterone treatment14. There are two forms of PHA1: renal PHA1, which is milder and involves a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor; and systemic PHA1, which involves a mutation in a gene for ENaC α, β, or γ15,16. Patients with systemic PHA1 are unable to retain any salt, and so become severely dehydrated and have high potassium, low sodium, and increased acidity in their blood3. This makes the disease particularly deadly to newborns, and requires life-long supplementation with sodium and the potassium elimination drug Kayexalate17. Contrary to the pattern observed for Liddle Syndrome, most systemic PHA1 mutations occur in the gene encoding ENaCα17. The majority of described PHA1 mutations are nonsense mutations, although three missense mutations have been described16–18. One of these mutations occurs in the palm domain, one in the transmembrane domain, and one likely in the intracellular domain.Although the genes for the β and γ subunits are both on chromosome 16 and the gene for ENaCα is on chromosome 12, no difference in the rates of mutation for the affected genes are seen between patients and control groups17.\n\n\n1.1.2 ENaC in the lung\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disorder which affects many organs, but most prominently the lungs. Patients with CF have thick airway mucus they are unable to clear, causing chronic airway infections and lung damage. Patients with CF also lose salt but, unlike patients with PHA1, the causative mutation is in the CFTR gene rather than an ENaC gene.\nCFTR encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, CFTR19. Pathogenic CFTR mutations dramatically reduce chloride permeability, resulting in poor reabsorption of NaCl20. In the lung, this chloride secretion is balanced by sodium uptake via ENaC, which in turn regulates the thickness of the airway surface liquid (ASL)21. Reduced chloride absorption due to mutant CFTR increases the absorption of sodium. This, in turn, dehydrates and thickens the ASL, which damages the underlying tissue and prevents mucous clearance22,23.\nThe interplay between CFTR and ENaC in CF patients is complicated and not fully understood. Treatment of normal, but not CF, lung epithelia with amiloride augments Cl- transport24. Cells co-expressing CFTR and ENaC show smaller ENaC currents than do cells expressing only ENaC, but this effect depends both CFTR’s ability to pass Cl- and ENaC’s intracellular termini25. Mice which overexpress βENaC in the airway show CF-like symptoms, including reduced airway liquid height and mucous clearance26. It seems, then, that the function of the two ion channels is linked both by electrochemical gradients and potentially other regulatory partners.Interestingly, mice overexpressing the α or γ subunits did not show CF-like symptoms. The authors point to prior research showing that αβ-only channels have a higher PO than αβγ27.\nThe picture turns out not to be quite so neat. Double-mutant mice which overexpress βENaC and CFTR have normal Cl- secretion but neither a concomitant decrease in Na+ absorption nor a rescue of the CF-like phenotype28. Additionally, Liddle syndrome patients have increased sodium absorption throughout their body but neither they nor Liddle syndrome mice develop lung disease29. Human patients with reduced βENaC function develop CF-like phenotypes of lung infection and elevated sweat chloride, but PHA1 patients produce excessive airway liquid without infection30,31. There are many hypothesis as to how these contradictions may be resolved, reviewed well by Collawn and colleagues, but more work on the subject is desperately needed32. One important point is that, as with Liddle syndrome, the mouse CF model does not recapitulate human disease well. Indeed, mice with CFTR mutations which are pathogenic in humans do not develop lung disease at all33.\n\n\n1.1.3 ENaC in the tongue\nAs one might expect for a sodium-specific ion channel, ENaC is also implicated in taste. Although it may seem a less clinically-essential tissue, ENaC function and expression in the tongue differs significantly from what is expected based on the better-studied kidney. It is therefore useful as a spotlight on how little we still know about the very basic stoichiometry and function of the ENaC subunits.\nThe organization of taste in the mammalian tongue is complex, but well-reviewed by Yarmolinsnky and colleagues34. Briefly, taste buds comprise 50–100 taste receptor cells (TRCs). Each TRC expresses receptors for and responds to just one of the five basic tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami35,36. These receptors are highly diverse, with closely-related species having widely varying taste responses to the same molecule.For instance, hamsters do not taste aspartame as sweet37.\nSalt sensation is further divided into an appetitive taste (a potato chip) and an aversive taste (sea water). Amiloride blocks rats’ ability to taste the difference between KCl and NaCl and reduces their voluntary NaCl (but not KCl) consumption38,39. Thus, the appetitive taste is taken to result from Na+ currents in amiloride-sensitive TRCs, while the aversive NaCl taste results from Cl- currents in amiloride-insensitive TRCs40. ENaC seems a prime candidate for the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current; indeed all three subunits are detected in taste buds but not the surrounding epithelia41. Mice with αENaC specifically knocked-out in mature TRCs lost their preference for salt, and those TRCs no longer responded to low Na+ concentrations42. However, recent work has significantly complicated the role of αβγ ENaC in salt taste.\nInvestigation of ENaC expression patterns in mouse taste buds show that no taste bud cell expresses both the α and β subunits43. This result is further complicated by the fact that amiloride-sensitive salt perception depends on the mouse line, and the line used in the expression pattern study has a low amiloride sensitivity44. Thus the possibility remains that salt taste in mice is mediated by αβγENaC and is simply harder to detect with this experimental setup. However, as discussed further in section , αENaC is sufficient to form small (100 times smaller than αβγ) currents when expressed alone in oocytes45. Homomeric α channels may instead carry the amiloride-sensitive salt taste. Perhaps more importantly, salt taste in humans is insensitive to amiloride46. Additionally, humans express δENaC (a fourth subunit which is a pseudogene in rats and mice) in the taste bud, rather than αENaC47.\nThe mouse model of taste, much like that of cystic fibrosis and Liddle syndrome, seems to be a poor facsimile of the process in humans. Despite this fact, salty taste illustrates an important unanswered question regarding ENaC: what is the full compliment of physiologically-relevant functional ENaC channels? As covered in , the two canonical channels comprise one each of the β, γ, and either α or δ subunits. However, the combination of αENaC knock-out mice and ENaC expression patterns makes it apparent that channels with only a single ENaC subunit, while rare, are physiologically relevant. I note here that we cannot say these channels are homomeric αENaC channels. They may be assemblies of ENaC with other ENaC/DEG family members or as-yet unknown other proteins. Regardless of the ultimate identity of the amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor, the patterns observed in taste are difficult to explain if the only physiologically relevant ENaC is the α/δβγ triheteromer, which makes it an interesting and valuable system for further study.\n\n\n1.1.4 ENaC in blood vessels\nMyogenic vasoconstriction is an important component of blood pressure regulation in which the diameter of a blood vessel decreases in response to increased blood pressure. This response is essential for maintaining proper blood flow. ENaC is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells responsible for the constriction of blood vessels48,49. Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives reduces myogenic tone in a dose-dependent manner. This fact, combined with the knowledge that ENaC relatives are mechanosensitive in worms makes ENaC a likely candidate for the pressure sensor responsible for myogenic vasoconstriction50.Not to belabor an earlier point, but only β and γ ENaC are detected in ex vivo preparations of vascular smooth muscle cells, while those subunits plus α are detected in cultured cells.\nSimilarly, systemic blood pressure is monitored by the central nervous system via baroreceptors. Baroreceptors keep mean arterial pressure at a steady level on a short time scale51. These neurons express β and γ, but not α, ENaC52. Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives blocks both the response of these neurons to physical stimulation and blood pressure regulation. It therefore seems likely that ENaC is used by baroreceptors to sense blood pressure, but further research is necessary to strictly define this role.\n\n\n1.1.5 ENaC in the colon\nENaC plays an important role in sodium reabsorption in the colon. Colon expression of the β and γ, but not α, subunits increases in response to aldosterone treatment13,53. Patients with Crohn’s disease, a chronic inflammatory bowl disease, have reduced sodium reabsorption in the colon, which leads to diarrhea54,55. Similarly, patients with ulcerative colitis have diarrhea due to inhibition of ENaC expression by inflammatory cytokines56. To be clear, the colon relies on a wide array of systems to reabsorb ions and water. These results indicate that ENaC is one of the players in this process."

    "section": "1.2 Regulation",
    "text": "1.2 Regulation\n\n\n\nFigure 1.1: Simplified model of ENaC regulation in a principal cell of the distal nephron in the kidney.\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise that expression of ENaC is under tight control, given the number of important processes ENaC is implicated in. In this section I provide a general, by no means exhastive review of proteins known to regulate ENaC. The exact molecular mechanisms by which ENaC PO is modulated are covered in  This overview of ENaC regulation is necessarily brief and focuses on regulation in the kidney (Figure 1.1), since that system is best understood. Fortunately, the patterns observed in the kidney largely hold in other tissues.\n\n1.2.1 Aldosterone\nAldosterone is the primary mineralocorticoid hormone and the main mechanism by which the body regulates its sodium levels. When the kidney is not receiving enough salt, it initiates a cascade to (among many other effects) increase activity of ENaC via the hormone aldosterone. ENaC is also regulated by other hormonal signals, including vasopressin and insulin, but a review of those mechanisms is outside the scope of this work. For the interested reader, Garty and Palmer’s review of the complete picture of ENaC regulation is quite thorough if a bit old59.For a review of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System consider Weir and Dzau57. For a review more focused on aldosterone alone, Stockand’s is quite thorough and readable58.\nAldosterone response is divided into two phases, aptly named the early and late phases. Aldosterone increases ENaC PO in part via increased activity of serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK, Section 1.2.3)60,61. SGK’s effect has mainly been attributed to inhibition of Nedd4-2 (Section 1.2.2), while some labs also report a direct increase in ENaC PO62,63. Aldosterone also stimulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and K-Ras, which physically couples ENaC and PI3K64,65. Phospholipids have both short- and long-term effects on ENaC currents and are discussed further in Section 2.2.2.1.\nAldosterone’s late phase increase of sodium permeability is mediated both by direct increase of ENaC gene expression and movement of ENaC from an internal pool to the apical membrane66–69. In some studies, aldosterone increases transcription of the β- and γ- (but not α-) ENaC genes13,66,70–72. In others, increases in αENaC transcription are also (or exclusively) observed69,73–77. The effect of aldosterone does seem to be consistent within tissue types: most studies demonstrating an increase in αENaC transcription are performed in the kidney, while aldosterone increases β and γ transcription in the colon. ENaC transcription in the lung is less dependent on circulating aldosterone levels than other tissues78.\n\n\n1.2.2 Nedd4-2\nNedd4-2, also known as Nedd4L, is a HECT E3 ubiquitin ligase. E3 ligases perform the final step in the ubiquitination cascade: the transfer of an activated ubiquitin (Ub) from an E2 to the substrate. Nedd4-2 is the cognate E3 ligase for ENaC in humans, rats, and mice (but not Xenopus). Ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4-2 results in internalization and degradation of the channel, reducing the cell’s Na+ permeability. Disruption of this mechanism is the most common cause of Liddle syndrome (Section 1.1.1), indicating the essential role Nedd4-2 plays in regulation of ENaC surface expression.In older literature, this process is called “Sodium Feedback Inhibition”.\n\n1.2.2.1 Nedd4-2 Structure\nLike many members of the HECT ligase family, Nedd4-2 has an N-terminal C2 domain, three or four (depending on the species) WW domains, and a C-terminal HECT domain. As the astute reader has already guessed, humans also express a closely-related HECT E3 ligase, Nedd4, which does not regulate ENaC in vivo79,80. It is important to note that expressing either of these two ligases heterologously does inhibit ENaC. This makes evaluation of the Nedd4-2/ENaC literature complicated, as conclusions drawn from heterologous systems may not hold in the organism. In any case, the two proteins are 63% identical, and although there are differences in substrate affinity, the function of the domains in an abstract sense is quite similar. As such, I will present research on both proteins, preferring results from Nedd4-2 when possible, and highlighting points where the findings may not be fully generalizable.\nThe C2 domain is a Ca2+-dependent phospholipid and protein binding domain. Increased intracellular Ca2+ induces translocation of Nedd4 from the cytosol to the membrane82. Interestingly, the Nedd4-2 C2 domain specifically localizes the protein to the apical membrane (to which ENaC also localizes). This apical targeting is the result of an interaction between the C2 domain and Annexin XIIIb83.For a good review of general C2 domain evolution, structure, and function see Rizo and Südhof81.\nWW domains are protein-protein interaction domains comprising a three-stranded β-sheet. These small domains bind PY-motifs (PPXY), including those found in each ENaC subunit (PPAY, PPNY, PPKY in human α, β, and γ respectively). It is the removal of these domains that causes Liddle syndrome in truncation mutants84. Nedd4-2 cannot bind the Liddle mutants, and so the cell cannot pull the open channels from the surface, resulting in a gain of function. Interestingly, mice and rat Nedd4-2 have three WW domains, while human Nedd4-2 has four.\nThe HECT domain is the business end of the protein. Unlike RING ligases, HECT ligases form a thioester bond with Ub before transferring it to the substrate. The domain itself is split into the N-lobe, which is larger and interacts with the E2 enzyme, and the C-lobe, which contains the catalytic cysteine.Buetow and Huang’s review of E3 ligase structure is very good, and includes HECT ligases85.\nHECT ligases have several auto-inhibitory functions to prevent inappropriate ubiquitination. The C2 domain of a related HECT ligase intramolecularly binds the HECT domain near the catalytic cysteine, blocking function86. The HECT domain also has an internal PY motif which is bound by its own WW domain87. Nedd4-2 remains bound this way until it encounters a substrate, at which point it binds and ubiquitinates the target. The enzyme then ubiquitinates itself, targeting it for degradation. Finally, the linker between WW domains 2 and 3 blocks function of the HECT domain in Nedd488.It is not currently known which WW domain binds this internal PY motif, or if the association is intra- or intermolecular.\n\n\n1.2.2.2 Nedd4-2 and ENaC\nNedd4-2 is expressed throughout the body, but is most abundant in the kidney and lung89. In a high-salt binds and ubiquitinates ENaC, causing the channels to be internalized and degraded62,90–92. The functional importance of lipid binding by the C2 domain for this role is unclear. In heterologous systems, both Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 are able to inhibit ENaC currents with or without a C2 domain, and both rats and humans express splice variants of Nedd4-2 which is missing the C2 domain93–96. In fact, C2-less Nedd4 suppresses ENaC currents more than WT Nedd4 in heterologous systems93,97. Many heterologous studies in which Nedd4 inhibits ENaC were performed with a C2-less isoform, further indicating that it may be the C2 inhibition of the HECT domain that prevents ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4. However, mice expressing Nedd4-2 without a C2 domain fail to regulate ENaC in response to a high-salt diet and develop hypertension, leaving open the possibility that the membrane-binding functionality is more important in vivo98.\nNedd4-2 relies on a subset of its WW domains to bind and regulate ENaC. In humans, only WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4-2 are required to reduce ENaC currents99. Human WW2 does bind ENaC weakly, while WW1 does not seem to interact with any ENaC subunit. Differential affinity among the WW domains is observed in other species as well93,100.Nedd4-2 does regulate many other proteins — it is possible that WW1 is required to regulate these other targets.\nOnce ENaC is bound, the HECT domain begins ubiquitinating N-terminal lysines on the channel92. Although lysines in each subunit are ubiquitinated, the γ subunit lysines are required for ubiquitination of α and β. Ubiquitination of ENaC by Nedd4-2 is opposed by constitutive deubiquitination by several deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs)101–103. Interestingly, DUBs increase the relative amount of cleaved ENaC at the cell surface. It is not known whether this effect is a direct result of DUB binding and action, or a simple follow-on effect of longer surface dwell time due to reduced recycling.\nHECT domains are capable of serial ubiquitin addition, in which the C-terminus of ubiquitin is connected to the N-terminus or one of several lysines on the nascent chain104. Different chains determine the ultimate fate of the tagged protein; Nedd4-2 preferentially produces chains of ubiquitin connected by lysine 63 (K63 chains)105. K63 chains most often send substrates somewhere other than the proteasome for degradation or recycling. In the specific case of ENaC, some groups have reported lysosomal degradation, while others report a combination of proteasomal and lysosomal targeting91,92,107. Regardless of ubiquitinated ENaC’s ultimate destination, it is clear that the interplay of Nedd4-2 and ENaC is critical to the overall sodium permeability of the cell.For a review of the roles different ubiquitin chains play, I recommend Komander and Rape106.\n\n\n\n1.2.3 SGK and 14-3-3\nSerum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) is a serine/threonine kinase expressed in several tissues including heart, brain, lung, and kidney108. Transcription of SGK is directly induced by a multitude of signals, including aldosterone61,63,109. Mice lacking SGK present a salt-wasting phenotype and high serum aldosterone, similar to the symptoms seen in PHA1 patients (Section 1.1.1)110. SGK increases ENaC surface expression and currents by disrupting the Nedd4-2/ENaC interaction by phosphorylating Nedd4-277,80,111. SGK is itself, in turn, ubiquitinated by Nedd4-2113. This establishes a tight negative feedback loop which imparts a sharper temporal dependence of SGK expression on aldosterone. SGK also directly interacts with and phosphorylates αENaC114,115. This association increases ENaC activity, explaining the observation that SGK also increases currents from channels lacking the C-terminal PY motif116.Interestingly, SGK has an internal PY motif which is critical for Nedd4-2 binding112. It’s not known whether this PY motif, 14-3-3 bridging, or both are necessary for Nedd4-2 ubiquitination of SGK.\nPhosphorylated Nedd4-2 is bound and inhibited by 14-3-3, which is a protein that binds other phosphorylated regulatory proteins117,118. Humans express seven isoforms of 14-3-3; at least the β, ε, and η isoforms are known to dimerize and regulate Nedd4-2119,120. 14-3-3 binds with a high affinity to Nedd4-2 phosphorylated at serines 342 and 448. 14-3-3 binding reduces the solvent accessibility of and rearranges WW domains 3 and 4 (essential for ENaC binding) and the catalytic cysteine120,121. It is likely, then, that 14-3-3 regulates Nedd4-2 both by blocking its catalytic activity and preventing its binding to ENaC.Pohl and colleagues demonstrate that all seven isoforms are able to bind at least one of the two 14-3-3 binding sites in Nedd4-2, but this does not necessarily translate to inhibition of Nedd4-2 function120."

    "text": "1.3 Conclusion\nENaC is a tightly-regulated ion channel implicated in a vast array of biological functions, from blood pressure control to the pleasurable taste of salty food. I have provided here a brief overview of the tissues in which ENaC expression is responsive to aldosterone (the body’s main salt regulatory hormone) as well as the proteins involved on coordinating its expression. I hope I have also highlighted the great amount we do not know about the channel. ENaC’s function and regulation in the kidney is well-studied, but the trends observed in that tissue do not translate well to the lung (in which Liddle syndrome patients do not develop disease) or tongue (in which no heterotrimeric channels seem to exist). Additionally, the transcriptional and translational responses to aldosterone differ in different tissues.\nRegardless, a deeper understanding of ENaC is necessary for a deeper understanding of the disorders and diseases covered in this chapter. To that end, I next present some background on what we know about ENaC currents and what we can infer about its molecular mechanism of gating based on related channels.\n\n\n\n\n1. Guyton, A.C.

    "title": "2  ENaC Currents, Structure, and Gating",
    "section": "2.1 ENaC Structure",
    "text": "2.1 ENaC Structure\nENaC is a heterotrimeric protein comprising one copy each of αENaC, βENaC, and γENaC arranged clockwise when viewed from the extracellular side. Each subunit is approximately 30% identical to the others, and all three share a topology common to the entire ENaC/DEG family. In this section I will provide an overview of previous findings from our lab1,2.This is only marginally higher than the approximately 25% identity they each have with related channel ASIC1.\nI will also make extensive analogy to a closely-related channel, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC). Throughout this document, when I refer to ASIC, I specifically mean ASIC1 unless I specify a different paralog. ASIC is another member of the ENaC/DEG family which is activated by protons. I recommend Yoder and colleagues’ excellent overview of ASIC’s gating mechanism to interested readers3.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: Cartoon representation of an ENaC subunit. Each domain is labeled, and important functions are noted next to the labels.\n\n\nEach subunit has short intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2, which together form the transmembrane domain, TMD), and a relatively large extracellular domain (ECD), which is further subdivided into domains named for their vague resemblance of a left hand grasping a ball (Figure 2.1). All told, the α, β, and γ subunits are 75, 72, and 74 kDa respectively. Uncleaved channels typically run a bit higher (between 75 and 90 kDa) on SDS-PAGE due to SDS binding and extensive glycosylation. \n\n2.1.1 Scaffolding — the palm, β-ball, and knuckle\nThe palm (yellow) comprises a twisted β-sheet of seven β-strands (β1, 3, 6, and 9–12). The β-ball forms (as one might expect) a tightly-twisted ball of four β-strands: β2, 4, 5, and 7. The knuckle, comprising only a single α-helix (α6) is connected to the extracellular end of the palm.\nAlthough the palm does lie along the pseudo-threefold symmetry axis, the ion permeation pathway of ASIC suggests that it is probably not involved in passing Na+ currents4. The palm instead forms the structural scaffold of each subunit, connecting the finger and knuckle at the extracellular edge of the domain to the thumb at the membrane-adjacent end. About a third of each subunit’s buried surface area (1,667 out of 4,662 Å2 for αENaC) is in the palm, despite it containing only about a fifth of the modeled residues. Given this outsize role in establishing channel topology, it is no surprise that the palm likely plays a pivotal role in channel gating.\nWhen ASIC opens, the palm pivots around the β-ball (orange), moving inward by approximately 4 Å5. This movement is coupled to the TMD, opening the pore. The same overall mechanism is expected in ENaC and has support from cross-linking studies6. The α and β palm domains and the α knuckle also host glycosylation sites (discussed further in ) which are required for mechanosensitive gating. \nIn ASIC, the knuckle is largely uninvolved in gating and is considered a rather inert part of the palm/knuckle scaffold. In contrast, ENaC’s knuckle is an important source of heterogeneity between the three subunits. The carboxyl terminus of α6 differs between the three subunits, and its interface with the adjacent subunit’s finger domain may contribute to the enforcement of a clockwise subunit arrangement2.\n\n\n2.1.2 Gating — the finger, thumb, and GRIP\nThe finger, thumb, and gating relief of inhibition by proteolysis (GRIP) domains form the essential regulatory machinery of the channel. The finger domain (blue) comprises three alpha helices (α1–3). The thumb domain (green) comprises two large helices, α4 and 5.When we were publishing the first structure of ENaC, we struggled to find a good backronym for GRIP. My suggestion of Good, Really Important Part was rejected.\nThe α- and γGRIP domains (cyan) are, as the name painstakingly makes clear, expected to be cleaved during channel gating (see Section 2.2.1). The βGRIP is not cleaved during canonical channel opening and is, perhaps relatedly, the GRIP for which we have the best structural information. We can model a sheet of two anti-parallel pairs of β-strands in βGRIP. The GRIP domain shrouds the interface between the finger and thumb, forming extensive contacts between the two.\nIn ASIC, protonation of an acidic pocket formed by the β-ball, finger, and thumb of a single subunit causes collapse of the thumb toward the finger. This pulls the palm (and therefore the TMD) away from the symmetry axis, opening the channel. In ENaC, no such acidic residues exist. Instead, an aromatic pocket is formed by the finger, thumb, and GRIP domains. Based on this similar architecture and a slew of cross linking studies, it is thought that the GRIP domain forms a wedge between the finger and thumb, preventing their collapse7–9.\n\nIndeed, the Kleyman laboratory has identified short segments of the GRIP domain (eight and eleven amino acids in α and γENaC, respectively) which, when flowed over open channels, close them10–12. These peptides are part of the P1 strand and pack tightly against α2 of the finger domain. We have hypothesized that cleavage and subsequent removal of the P3 strand releases P1 and, therefore, decouples the finger and thumb2. From here, we and others have proposed that the gating mechanism is more-or-less that of ASIC: the finger and thumb collapse, and their movement pulls the palm and TMD away from the pore axis.The α peptide is LPHPLQRL, and RFSHRIPLLIF that of the γ subunit.\n\nThe new results from FaNaC call this assumption into question13. The finger and thumb do not collapse in FaNaC. Rather, they move in a concerted action up and away from the membrane, toward the α6 helix of the adjacent knuckle domain.\nIt is worth noting here that while FaNaC is gated by peptide binding (as is ENaC, after a fashion), FaNaC’s ligand binding pocket is distinct from ENaC’s. The FaNaC peptide binds a pocket comprising α2, the β6-β7 linker, and α6 from the adjacent subunit, i.e., the finger and knuckle. ENaC’s GRIP domain interacts instead with the thumb and finger. Since the FaNaC pocket is on “the other side” of the finger, it would not be entirely surprising if the movement of the finger in the two channels is different.\nA histidine in the β9-α4 loop of FaNaC (which connects the palm and thumb) points down between TM1 and TM2. Mutation of this histidine to serine results in constitutively-active channels, implying that the energy gained by ligand binding is used to overcome the interaction of this histidine with the TMs. Alignments place bulky residues in this position for both ASIC and ENaC (tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively).\n\n\n2.1.3 Conduction — what we expect for the TMD\nAs yet, no map of ENaC has reliable density for the transmembrane domain. Nevertheless, we can infer a great deal from electrophysiological studies of ENaC and maps of other members of the ENaC/DEG family, mostly the well-studied ASIC. Excitingly, the first structures of another ENaC/DEG family member, FMRFamide-gated sodium channel 1 (FaNaC 1; FaNaC in this document), were published during the production of this document13. Not only is FaNaC more closely related to ENaC, but its overall similar architecture to both ENaC and ASIC provide more support for the idea that the general gating is similar among the entire family.\nASIC’s gating cycle comprises three states: resting, open, and desensitized. The pore of the first solved structure of ASIC was asymmetric, but this truncated crystallization construct did not conduct sodium currents14. Subsequent structures of ASIC show symmetric pores in all three states.\n\nIn the resting state of ASIC, negative charges clustered in the acidic pocket (formed by the finger, thumb, and β-ball) hold the finger and thumb apart. Interestingly, TM2 is split halfway through the membrane, with the C-terminal side swapping to complete the TM2 of the adjacent (clockwise) subunit. This domain swap forms a triangular arrangement of short Gly-Ala-Ser loops, called the GAS belt. The GAS belt forms ASIC’s selectivity filter16. The homologous residues in the α-, β-, and γENaC (GSS, GGS, and SCS respectively) play a significant role in that channel’s selectivity, implying the same pore structure and domain swap17,18.Evolutionary analysis suggests that a non-swapped conformation may have some physiological relevance, but no functional structure of this state has been solved15.\nThe conical region below the GAS belt and between TMs was believed to be filled with unstructured lipids. However, a recent structure of ASIC revealed that the N-terminus briefly re-enters the membrane to buttress the GAS belt19. The re-entrant loop also houses the highly-conserved N-terminal two-residue His-Gly pair (the HG motif). The HG motif is critically important in gating and selectivity of ENaC, and likely plays a similar role in other ENaC/DEG family members20–22. The HG motif supports the GAS belt through several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with adjacent TM2s, stabilizing this otherwise-fragile structure.\n\nAs mentioned previously, low pH protonates residues in the acidic pocket formed by the finger, thumb, and β-ball. This relieves electrostatic repulsion and allows the finger/thumb interface to collapse, pulling the palm and TMD inward and opening a lateral fenestration just above the membrane5. In the open state, the ions pass from the extracellular fenestration down a negatively-charged pore through the GAS belt, and into the intracellular fenestration. The GAS belt selects for Na+ over other cations by a “sieving mechanism”, physically preventing the passage of ions with hydrated radii too large for the filter. It is worth noting here that ENaC’s significantly higher Na+ selectivity and lower unitary currents suggest that, unlike ASIC, Na+ ions are dehydrated before passing through ENaC23. We thus expect that ENaC’s selectivity filter will be significantly narrower than that of ASIC24.\nUnlike ENaC, ASIC desensitizes. In desensitized ASICs, the β11-β12 linker in the palm domain is flipped toward the channel center4. This decouples the still-collapsed finger and thumb domains from the lower palm and TMD, allowing the fenestration to close. In essence, the desensitized channels have an open ECD but a closed TMD. As ENaCs do not desensitize, it remains to be seen whether the β11-β-12 linker plays a role in gating."

    "section": "2.2 Direct regulation of ENaC",
    "text": "2.2 Direct regulation of ENaC\n\n2.2.1 Proteases\nProteolytic activation of ENaC was discovered shortly after the channel itself. Overnight treatment of Xenopus laevis bladder with aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) dramatically reduced ENaC currents; the same effect was observed in an X. laevis cell line25,26. ENaC currents were quickly rescued by treatment with the serine protease trypsin. Thus, an activating role for proteases was established.\nThe first indication that proteases acted directly upon ENaC appeared when researchers observed multiple distinct populations of ENaC at the cell surface, ranging from the so-called “near-silent” population with a low PO (less than 0.02) to the high PO channels which are essentially constitutively open (PO ≅ 0.9)27,28. Treatment with exogenous trypsin activated the near-silent channels29. And, finally, Hughey and colleagues reported direct cleavage of ENaC itself30.\nProstasin was the first protease found to activate ENaC26. Furin’s role in channel activation was reported shortly thereafter30. Prostasin is a membrane-associate serine protease, expressed highly in prostate and seminal fluid and moderately in other tissues including colon, lung, and kidney31. In contrast to prostasin’s relatively circumscribed expression, furin (also a serine protease) is expressed in essentially all human tissues. Furin plays a role in a vast array of biological processes including ENaC activation and is well-reviewed by Thomas32.The first prostasin homolog described was that of X. laevis, where it is still named Channel Activating Protease 1 (CAP1) for this reason.\nBoth furin and prostasin are enteropeptidases which cleave following polybasic tracts (i.e., stretches of amino acids with multiple Lys or Arg residues). Both αENaC and γENaC have canonical cleavage sites in their extracellular domains30. The relative contribution of each of these sites to PO is still unclear and seems to be tissue dependent. The hypothetical molecular mechanism of channel opening is covered in more detail in.  In addition to prostasin, γENaC is also cleaved and activated by a wide repertoire of different proteases in different tissues33–43.\nProteolytic activation has been described in great detail in a wide range of in vitro systems, but the link is not quite so obvious in vivo. For instance, mice treated with aprotinin show reduced ENaC activity as expected44. However, when mice are fed a low-sodium diet, the appearance of cleaved ENaC and increases in amiloride-sensitive current are largely independent45. It is thus not obvious that the direct cleavage/current relationship observed in vitro is true in vivo. What’s more, while proteolytic cleavage may be the main pathway by which ENaC is opened, ENaC is also sensitive to other signals.\n\n\n2.2.2 The membrane\n\n2.2.2.1 Phospholipids\nLike many ion channels, ENaC is modulated by phospholipids. For instance, ENaC is known to segregate into lipid rafts46,47. Cholesterol alone does not activate the channel, but it does facilitate the interaction between phosphatidylinositol and binding sites in the β and γ subunits49,50. This interaction is absolutely required for ENaC opening.Lipid rafts are proposed regions of the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. While there is clearly some kind of spatial-compositional heterogeneity in cell membranes, the existence of lipid rafts in particular is still an open question47,48.\nTreatment of inside-out patches with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) increases ENaC PO within seconds, and PO is reduced again upon PIP2 removal, ruling out the possibility of PIP2-induced proteolytic cleavage51,52. Similarly, no change in channel number is observed in these experiments PIP2. A similar dependence of ENaC current on PIP2 levels is observed in mouse trachea53. Note that more PIP2 than is necessary does not result in greater ENaC currents — that is, a lack of PIP2 reduces ENaC currents but PIP2 does not itself potentiate them54.\nUnlike PIP2, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP3) does augment ENaC currents both directly and via a signaling cascade. In its immediate effect, PIP3 binds γENaC just after the second transmembrane domain to rapidly open the channel54–56. PIP3 also increases the number of channels at the cell surface in a longer cascade mediated by SGK (Section 1.2.3)57. In fact, aldosterone’s effect on SGK is mediated by PI3K and PIP358.Interestingly, mutation of negatively-charged residues in the γENaC PIP3 binding site increases ENaC currents both with and without PIP356.\nENaC’s dependence on phosphatidylinositols presents a problem. PIPs are rare enough in the membrane that, if the lipids and channel were both freely diffusing, the expected PO of ENaC would be far lower than what is observed59,60. MARCKS is a lipid-binding protein which sequesters PIP2 and PIP3 into regions of high local concentration61. MARCKS also binds ENaC, potentially anchoring the channel in a region of the membrane with a high enough local concentration PIPs for the proper channel PO62.MARCKS is itself subject to regulation by a wide range of signals, which in turn affect ENaC currents. For instance, ENaC currents depend on Ca2+ in an effect mediated by calmodulin and then MARCKS63. In an amusing symmetry, MARCKS is itself regulated by proteolysis64.\n\n\n2.2.2.2 Palmitoylation\nPalmitoylation is a reversible process in which hydrophobic chains are attached to cysteine residues, anchoring them in the membrane. Multiple cysteines in β- and γENaC are palmitoylated (but none in αENaC), with varying effects65–67.\nBlocking palmitoylation of two cysteines in βENaC (in mouse: C43 and C557) significantly reduces ENaC currents65. This effect is not mediated by differences in trafficking or cleavage but by changes in channel PO, specifically increased SSI. C43 is suggestively close to the HG motif; it may be that membrane anchoring of this cysteine aids in proper folding of the re-entrant loop and therefore the pore. This conjecture is supported by the observation in the same study that C557A mutants have significantly increased unitary conductance.\nγENaC also has two palmitoylated cysteines, C33 and C41, which straddle that subunit’s HG motif67. Again, C→A mutation of these cysteines increase SSI without affecting surface exposure or channel cleavage. Surprisingly, addition of a β palmitoylation mutant to a mutant γ background does not further reduce currents — put another way, the γ mutations are dominant.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "3.1 The TMD is misfolded\nOur previous structural work was focused on wild-type-like channels, with undefined gating states1. I wondered if channels with a defined open state might provide a more consistent, and therefore higher resolution, TMD. To this end, I created mutant channels (CKO/DEG) which contained two mutations expected to increase channel PO. The first, βS520K, holds the channel open regardless of proteolytic cleavage state2. The second, αT240W, which reduces the affinity of the channel for the α inhibitory peptide3. I solved maps of the CKO/DEG channels with and without C8 PIP2, a ligand known to open ENaC without proteolysis4.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: The ENaC transmembrane domain adopts two conformations. TMDs of all six ENaC models separated by TM conformation, viewed from the intracellular side. Models are in the same position and at the same scale in each image, so positions are directly comparable. A grated circle is added in the same position to aid comparison between panels.\n\n\nIn all six of our models, the visible TMs are arranged in a roughly triangular fashion around a central helix (Figure 3.1 A). In CKO/DEG channels this helix is γ TM2. In all other models, the central helix is β TM2. I thus name the two conformations γ-in or β-in, respectively. I observe no change in the TMD open addition of PIP2. Unfortunately, αTM2 and γTM1 are only visible in the β-in conformation. The arrangement of and great distance between pore-forming TM2 helices observed in our maps (Figure 3.2) also runs counter to existing knowledge of ENaC’s pore5. Given this surprising state and the low quality of the maps’ TMDs, I limit technical discussion of the TMD and hope that future studies will better resolve this critical channel domain. I do also note that although our cryoEM maps support the presence of the αT240W mutation, I observe no significant rearrangement of the nearby residues (Figure 3.3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3.2: Slices through the ENaC TMD reveal a non-physiological arrangement. Slices of the models with the best TMD density for both of β-in and γ-in (mouse trypsin and CKO/DEG difab, respectively) are displayed at four Z coordinates. The Cα of the residue closest to each Z coordinate is plotted in the horizontal XY plane and assigned a symbol to aid viewing. TM1 residues are circles; TM2 residues are squares. β-in residues have black borders, while γ-in residues have grey borders. Arrows connect the β-in residue to its cognate γ-in residue. If all three TM2 helices are modeled, they are connected by a triangle to represent the size of the pore at that Z slice.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.3: The αT240W mutation does not modify ECD conformation.

    "section": "3.2 Functional Assays",
    "text": "3.2 Functional Assays\nI will cover my work on developing functional assays here, since they would be most useful in assessing the quality of purified ENaC’s TMD. For the most part, I worked on two functional assays: the scintillation proximity assay (SPA) and the flux assay. Much of the work I present on SPA was performed alongside Alex Houser and especially James Cahill.\n\n3.2.1 The scintillation proximity assay does not show promise for ENaC/DEG family members\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.4: An example of SPA, in this case of CKO/DEG nanodiscs. Note that although the background counts have been subtracted, the relationship between ligand and counts is still linear.\n\n\n\nIn a SPA assay, the protein of interest is bound to beads which contain a scintillant. Radiolabeled ligand is then added to the mixture. If the ligand binds the protein, it is close enough to the beads that the β-particles can interact with the scintillant, emitting light. These counts can be taken as a measurement of binding affinity. Some argue that measuring affinity for a pore-binding ligand is a proxy for measuring proper folding of the pore6.\nI won’t cover in detail all the forms of SPA I attempted; none of the various optimizations or tweaks made any real difference in detectable ligand binding (Figure 3.4). Our main issue was non-specific binding. We could never measure the non-specific binding in its entirety, and so any signal that may potentially have been present was swamped out in noise. Changing from detergent sample to nanodiscs did not improve signal. Neither did changing from standard SPA beads to smaller, higher SNR nanoSPA beads.\nOne possible explanation of this is that none of our ENaC has a properly-folded TMD and therefore cannot bind amiloride or its derivatives. Indeed, that is what our maps seem to suggest. However, experiments performed with human ASIC show the same result: ever-increasing linear “specific” counts no matter the conditions (James Cahill, personal communication). However, this same ASIC protein has properly-folded TMs as assessed by cryoEM maps. These problems are not seen when other labs use the same reagents on different targets. Typically, when SPA doesn’t work, there are zero specific counts rather than some linearly-increasing unaccounted-for background. It may, then, be that SPA with tritiated amiloride derivatives does not work with, or is significantly more difficult for, members of the ENaC/DEG family.\n\n\n3.2.2 A sodium flux assay shows promise\nAfter abandoning SPA I went in search of a new, more direct means of assessing ENaC function. I had previously used a K+ flux assay when working on GIRK and decided to try adapting it to Na+ flux. For an example of this assay, see Figure 1C of Whorton and McKinnon7.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.5: A cartoon of a sodium flux assay. Red, yellow, and green circles are K+, Na+, and H+ respectively. White, green, and beige hyperbolae are sodium channels, CCCP, and Na+ ionophores respectively. Left: Vesicles with (top) or without (bottom) sodium channels are equilibrated in a buffer containing ACMA. Both are fluorescent because no pH gradient exists. Middle: CCCP is added to both mixtures. This quenches fluorescence in the ion channel vesicles by establishing a pH gradient. Right: Na+ ionophore is added to both mixtures. This measures the maximum fluorescence quenching possible in the prep.\n\n\nIn the canonical K+ flux assay, the protein of interest is incorporated into small unilamellar vesicles with potassium buffer inside and sodium outside (Figure 3.5). Thus, in vesicles with functional sodium-selective ion channels, potassium flows out of the vesicle, establishing an electrochemical gradient. The fluorescent dye ACMA is added to these vesicles. Then, the proton ionophore CCCP is added. In vesicles with functional ion channels, protons pass into the vesicles, down their gradient. This establishes a pH gradient, which quenches ACMA. Thus, reduced fluorescence at the CCCP stage indicates functional ion channels (Figure 3.6). Finally, valinomycin (a K+ ionophore) is added to measure the minimum fluorescence.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.6: A model example of flux data. ACMA fluorescence relative to the steady-state equilibrated value is plotted on Y, time on X. After the addition of each reagent the vesicles are allowed to equilibrate before addition of the next. In this example, it is clear the blue vesicles have functional ion channels since their fluorescence decreased with the addition of CCCP, while the grey vesicles are intact but do not have ion channels, since their fluorescence decreased with the addition of Na+ ionophore but not CCCP.\n\n\nTo adapt this protocol to Na+, all that was required is swapping to internal sodium and external potassium, and a sodium-specific ionophore to replace valinomycin. Luckily, several such ionophores are commercially available. None of them have quite the selectivity or flux of valinomycin, but they are less important than the CCCP anyway. I selected Sodium Ionophore IV, or 2,3:11,12-Didecalino-16-crown-58. This assay was, in the end, reliably able to produce readings of empty vesicles (Figure 3.7), but ENaC never passed any ions with the addition of CCCP (Figure 3.8). Moreover, addition of ENaC in any amount seemed to disrupt the empty vesicles. It is likely, then, that the ENaC is not properly folded, or that the addition of concentrated digitonin disrupts the vesicles on its own. A good next step in the development of this assay would be a positive control with ASIC or some other sodium channel.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.7: The Na+ flux assay reliably measures flux through empty vesicles composed of a variety of lipid mixes. Lipid mixes (colors) were tested for the ability to form vesicles as measured by the flux assay. Three different methods of forming vesicles were tested (facets).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3.8: The flux assay was performed with two lipid mixes (columns) and two vesicle formation methods (rows). In addition to the buffer control (grey), three ENaC:lipid ratios were tested: no ENaC, 1:600, and 1:200 (increasing color saturation). None of these show a decrease in fluorescence with addition of CCCP, indicating that there was no Na+ flux in any mixture."

    "text": "3.3 What can be salvaged?\nI’ve tried a great list of experiments to improve the quality of our TMD, none of which really worked. Here’s what of my work can be carried forward into future studies.\n\n3.3.1 Future studies should avoid digitonin\nI believe the TMD is misfolded as a result of solubilization with digitonin. Digitonin solubilizes membranes by chelating cholesterol9. ENaC preferentially exists in lipid rafts10. ENaC is activated by cholesterol-mediated PIP2 interactions11. Additionally, the helices in the low-resolution TMD region of truncated ENaC solved in DDM do have the expected TM2-inward layout12. Of course, all of the TMD maps to date are very low-resolution. Although I am confident in my TM assignments, it is possible that the wrong TM identity has been assigned to some of the densities. Hopefully future, higher-resolution maps of the TMD will settle the matter.\n\n\n3.3.2 Cysteine knock-out mutations should be abandoned\nThe CKO mutations do increase ENaC yield, but their theoretical underpinning is not sound at all. Channels with either one of γC33A and/or γC41A exhibit reduced current compared with wild type despite no change in surface expression13. Reduction in the double mutant currents is a result both of decreased PO and increased sodium self inhibition. γC33 and C41 border the HG motif — any disruption here might have serious consequences on the physiological relevance of a resolved TMD structure. Beyond the concerning question of whether the mutant channels would then recapitulate physiological ENaC gating processes, they clearly act in opposition to the goal of creating channels biased to the open state in CKO/DEG.Recall that CKO channels have the following mutations in addition to protease site knockouts: αC63A, βC30A, and γC33,41A\nConversely, if the goal is to disrupt palmitoylated sites (which, nominally, it was not), why are αC63 and βC30 knocked out when they are known not to be palmitoylated in the cell14? Or, if the goal is to knock out all potential palmitoylation sites, why are the majority left un-mutated? Fundamentally, the CKO mutations are logically inconsistent and should either be abandoned or consolidated behind a single theory of action.\n\n\n3.3.3 Acid shock\nI briefly tried “acid shocking” ENaC during the purification. My thinking was that poorly folded ENaC would be the first to aggregate under stressful conditions, leaving behind higher quality material. Similar treatments could have been high temperature or salt concentrations — there was nothing theoretically special about pH aside from the fact that ENaC and channels like it are sensitive to pH. I did not notice a difference in total yield (beyond the losses expected from salt exchange alone), leading me to believe that the procedure did not have any real effect on ENaC, regardless of its folding state. Additionally, maps made with acid-shocked material (CKO digitonin and CKO/DEG difab) are not of substantially higher quality than the other, un-shocked maps.\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "4.1 ECD conformation is unchanged by trypsin cleavage\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: In this section I show that cleavage of mouse ENaC with trypsin does not induce any detectable rearrangement of the ECD\n\n\nENaC can reliably be opened by trypsin treatment1. Additionally, the inhibitory peptide is easily resolved in all of my ECD maps. I wondered whether treatment with trypsin would result in movement of the finger and thumb domains as the model of ASIC-like gating movements predicts (Figure 4.1). It’s important to note here that I had significant help from Arpita Bharadwaj, who performed the purification and initial characterization of the mouse material for these grids. Both uncleaved and trypsin-treated mouse ENaC were of similar map quality (3.24 and 3.30 Å respectively with whole-protein masks).Recall that when protons bind ASIC’s acidic pocket, the finger and thumb move approximately 8 Å closer together2.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Purified ENaC is cleaved by trypsin. A: Western blot for α (left) and γ (right) ENaC. Purified mouse protein was treated with trypsin and aprotinin as indicated. Bands corresponding to full-length subunits are marked with an asterisk. B: Silver stain of material with and without trypsin treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: Trypsin treatment increases amiloride-sensitive currents in oocytes. Left: representative amiloride-sensitive current before (cyan) and after (orange) trypsin treatment. Only Na+ current is shown. Right: Average currents for all eight oocytes measured. All currents are scaled to pre-trypsin Na+ current to account for differential cell size and expression. Error bars represent 95% confidence interval. Values for individual oocytes are plotted as lines.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.4: cryoEM maps of mouse ENaC γ (left) and α (right) subunit GRIP domains without (yellow) and with (purple) trypsin treatment. The inhibitory peptide is colored in each map.\n\n\nBiochemical analyses show that trypsin treatment cleaves both the α and γ subunits (Figure 4.2). Additionally, trypsin treatment of X. laevis oocytes expressing mouse αβγENaC show the expected increase in amiloride sensitive current (Figure 4.3). However, aside from the disappearance of the inhibitory peptide, the ECD is otherwise superimposable (RMSD 0.440 Å; Figure 4.4). The finger and thumb do not shift even a fraction of what the ASIC-like model would predict. Based on the observed cryoEM map density, only the γ subunit GRIP domain is released from the channel despite the fact that biochemical characterization indicates both are digested by trypsin. I also note that the entire GRIP domain, not just the inhibitory peptide, has reduced map density in the trypsin-treated sample. This suggests that the entire grip domain might be released from the subunit, but of course it’s equally possible that release of the inhibitory peptide results in increased GRIP flexibility, which blurs out the map.\nThese results are incompatible with a large-scale movement of the ECD upon trypsin digestion. The existence of some γ GRIP density indicates that the trypsin-treated map is an ensemble of particles which have and have not released the γ GRIP domain. However, I do not observe any blurring of the γ thumb, which would be expected in a map comprising particles with significantly shifted conformations. I must therefore conclude that the removal of the γ inhibitory domain is not sufficient, on its own, to induce such changes. Additionally, I note that these maps are the first indication that trypsin processing of the α subunit does not release its GRIP domain. This is surprising but perhaps not wholly unexpected; the γ subunit is known to be essential for activation by trypsin but the same has not yet been shown for αENaC3.\n\n4.1.1 A strained tyrosine in the thumb\n\n\n\nFigure 4.5: A strained tyrosine rotamer is present in the γ subunit is released by trypsin cleavage. A: Human CKO γY425 (right), with approximate position indicated by a star in the cartoon (left). Hydrogen bonds are colored blue for ideal geometry and orange for slightly strained distance. B: γY425 (Y431 in mouse) colored by construct: human CKO, human CKO/DEG, mouse uncleaved, and mouse trypsin as red, blue, yellow, and purple respectively. C: αY447 (Y474 in mouse) colored by construct. D: Comparison of the inhibitory peptides of α (blue), β (red), and γ (magenta). The displayed model is human CKO digitonin, but the peptides are superimposable in all six models.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.6: CryoEM map potential for strained γENaC tyrosine for all maps/models. The maps are masked around the residue of interest.\n\n\nThe high-resolution maps of the γ ECD reveal an interesting rotamer outlier, γY425 (Figure 4.5). The map for this residue is of high quality in five of the six maps, supporting its unlikely (prior probability of 0.035%) conformation (Figure 4.6). The single map with poor quality is the trypsin-treated mouse map, in which the density is blurred and unclear. Human γY425 forms hydrogen bonds with the finger (H233) and inhibitory peptide (Figure 4.5 A). This tyrosine adopts the same pose in all models except the trypsin-treated mouse model, in which it may rotate to point toward the outer GRIP domain (Figure 4.5 B). Given the poor quality of γY431 (the equivalent position to human Y425) in the mouse trypsin map, I cannot assign this rotamer with certainty.\nThe equivalent residue in α is also a tyrosine (αY447 and 474 in human and mouse respectively), but the inhibitory peptide curves away from the channel center, removing the interactions with the backbone and aromatic oxygen atoms and allowing a more favored rotamer (Figure 4.5 C and D). The same position in β, N417, only forms a hydrogen bond with the finger domain (N225). The lack of any interactions between βN417 and the βENaC GRIP domain, which is not cleaved to open the channel, is further suggestive of this residue’s role in proteolytic gating. I note also that the map quality worsens for the nearby γM438, mutation of which alters channel gating4. The reduced quality for this map region upon trypsin treatment may represent increased flexibility, perhaps indicating that conformational strain in the upper thumb is released along with the inhibitory peptide."

    "section": "4.2 Sodium self-inhibition does not rearrange the ECD",
    "text": "4.2 Sodium self-inhibition does not rearrange the ECD\n\nUncleaved ENaC has a high PO at low external Na+ concentrations and a low PO at high external Na+; this attribute is called sodium self-inhibition (SSI)5. High extracellular K+ does not prime inhibition in wild-type channels and SSI is rapidly attenuated upon exposure to low (i.e., &lt;10 mM) Na+4,6. The linker connecting β6 and β7 is important for SSI, and I have previously reported evidence of a putative bound Na+ ion in this region6,7. Moreover, cross-linking of several pairs of amino acids in the ECD affects SSI magnitude, implying that some rearrangement is required for SSI6,8. Given this body of research, I solved structures of ENaC in high (200 mM) and low (nominal 0 mM Na+, 200 mM K+) sodium. I expected the high-Na+ model to show rearrangements throughout the ECD, as would be required to transfer Na+-binding state to the pore.\nOur maps of human CKO ENaC in Na+ and K+ buffers achieved resolutions of 2.3 and 3.0 Å, respectively. The Na+ structure was solved in digitonin with both the α- and β-binding Fabs, while the K+ structure was solved in nanodiscs without any Fabs. Although previously it has proven difficult to break the pseudo-threefold symmetry without including Fabs, I worried that their inclusion may affect SSI. Fortunately, the high quality of the cryoEM data allowed us to break the symmetry with neither Fabs nor an external reference — I believe the major symmetry breaking features are micelle-proximal glycans (Figure 4.7). Binding of either Fab induces minimal rearrangement of ENaC; the β epitope does not change conformation upon binding, while the α epitope pulls the loop from αP264-T274 approximately 4.5 Å away from the protein core without distorting the structure outside that loop.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.7: Fab binding induces only minor changes in the extracellular domain of ENaC. A: Human CKO/DEG map. A low-pass filtered map is outlined to show pseudosymmetry-breaking glycosylation sites (arrows). B: the α subunit, C: the β subunit. Human CKO nanodisc model is colored by subunit, the human CKO/DEG ENaC is white, and human CKO/DEG Fabs are grey.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.8: Presence or absence of Na+ does not rearrange the ECD. A: A previously identified ion-binding site still shows cryoEM map density with both Na+ (left) and K+ (right). The green dot corresponds to the previously-reported (PDB 6WTH) putative ion position. B: The β6-β7 linker in Na+ or K+ buffers.\n\n\nTo my surprise, no resolved region of the ECD undergoes any significant structural rearrangement between high- and low-Na+ buffers (RMSD 0.490 Å, Figure 4.8 A). Aside from the changes induced by the α-binding Fab, the only Cα shifts greater than 2 Å are residues terminating the resolved regions of the channel, which are likely a result of poor map quality. An acidic cleft in the αENaC finger, near the β-ball, is implicated in sodium self-inhibition6. However, the cryoEM maps have density for a ligand in the acidic cleft in both the Na+ and K+ maps (Figure 4.8 A), although the site is slightly expanded in the K+ map, perhaps to accommodate the larger K+ ion. The β6-β7 linker has high quality density in both maps, supporting an almost-identical (Cα RMSD 1.076 Å when the whole α subunit is aligned by the palm domain) conformation, aside from the blurring of αR333 across multiple rotamers (Figure 4.8 B).\nAlthough SSI is sensitive to pH, the buffer conditions for the CKO map should be at least 55% inhibited9. Attempts at detecting other classes of particle in the CKO ENaC (Na+) map were not successful, leading us to believe that the particles are homogeneous. The lack of any significant structural difference in the acidic pocket in the presence of Na+ and K+ is more compatible with an SSI model in which Na+-bound ENaC is “locked” in a closed state, rather than some third inhibited state."

    "text": "4.3 Glycans make important contacts among subunits and with the membrane\nGlycosylation of ENaC at conserved asparagine sites is essential for sodium self inhibition, trypsin activation, and mechanosensitivity10,11. The high-quality maps obtained in this study enable modeling of significantly more and longer glycans than in previous work. I find a total of 19 distinct glycosylation sites, with at most 9 sugars I am able to build into a single glycan. For the most part, the sugars are identical in all six models and make no protein or glycan interactions. These sugars likely play a role in other regulatory roles, such as channel trafficking and maturation or interaction with the extracellular matrix10–12. However, two classes of glycan are particularly interesting: the micelle-proximal and the intersubunit glycans.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.9: ENaC’s glycosylation sites form important intersubunit interactions. A: Cartoon overview of intersubunit glycosylations. Dotted lines represent glycan chains. Hexagons represent sugars, circles represent potentially-interacting residues. Unfiltered maps for the first two sugars are presented to indicate confidence in Asn assignment. B: Silver-stained SDS-PAGE gel of protein treated with PNGase F. C: Intersubunit glycan from βN260 to αD235, K495. D: Intersubunit interaction between glycans from βN207 (red) and γN271 (magenta). In both C and D, the solid surface is a gaussian-blurred version of the sharp human CKO digitonin map (mesh).\n\n\nThe intersubunit glycans stretch from one subunit to another (Figure 4.9 A). I am able to model long chains for these glycans, with some maps supporting up to nine monosaccharides. Due to the flexibility of these long chains, the terminal side is quite blurred out in the cryoEM maps, and so I cannot be confident about the exact orientation or identity of the constituent sugars. Nonetheless, the maps are of sufficient quality to at least suggest sugar-mediated interactions between subunits, and the first sugars are of sufficient resolution to assign the asparagine residues to which they are coupled. Treatment with PNGase F induces a size shift in the purified protein, confirming that the protein is glycosylated (Figure 4.9 B). I built typical high-mannose glycans (Man5GlcNAc2) into the models as expected for GnTI- and Sf9 cells to assess these interactions at a low resolution13,14. One glycan reaches from βN260 to the α subunit (Figure 4.9 C), potentially hydrogen bonding with αD235 and αK459. These three residues are absolutely conserved across ENaC genes surveyed. Similarly, glycans attached to conserved sites βN207 and γN271 connect the β GRIP to the γ palm (Figure 4.9 D). Knock-out of sugars in similar positions in αENaC increase blood pressure in mice11. The relatively high quality of these glycans suggest they are quite conformationally stable and may play a role in channel function.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.10: ENaC’s glycans contact the micelle. A: An overview of the position of the micelle-proximal glycans and the micelle. The image on the right is a zoomed view of the boxed region on the left. B and C: The sharpened map of human CKO digitonin for the first sugar attached to αN397 and βN364, respectively. D: In-grid rotation distribution for two selected classes of CKO nanodiscs. Note that both classes have even distribution of in-plane angles, indicating that the micelle tilt does not align with some grid force such as fluid flow during blotting. E: A cartoon representation of the position of the membrane-proximal glycans relative to the micelle tilt axis.\n\n\nThe micelle-proximal glycans are anchored to hαN397 and hβN364 and the equivalent mouse residues, mαN424 and mβN362 (Figure 4.10 A). The α site is conserved in mammalian ENaCs, while the β site is conserved in all surveyed organisms except lungfish. These glycans extend away from the ECD body and turn down toward the micelle or lipids and are clear in all ENaC maps solved to date. The γ subunit does not have an equivalent asparagine residue, and so does not have a micelle-proximal glycan. I note that all ENaC maps produced to date also show a consistent tilt of the micelle or nanodisc such that the γ subunit is closer to the surface of the micelle than are the α or β subunits; this tilt does not appear to be an artifact of in-plane rotation (Figure 4.10 B). I propose therefore that this tilt may in part be caused by the presence of the micelle-proximal glycans, which are only missing from γENaC (Figure 4.10 C). Their presence in the nanodisc map may indicate that they perform a similar role in a native cell membrane context."

    "text": "4.4 How does this change our understanding of the ECD?\n\n4.4.1 A misfolded TMD may uncouple ECD motions\nRegardless of the treatment applied, I cannot measure any change in the ECD. This stability stands in stark contrast to the highly dynamic ECD of the gating model widely assumed in the field and based on that of ASIC12,15. I observe trypsin cleavage of both the α and γ GRIP domains, but only reduced cryoEM map density for the γ domain. The maps are otherwise perfectly superimposable, with unchanged ECDs and TMDs. Removal of only the γ GRIP domain is surprising but not entirely unexpected — channels lacking the γ subunit or specific lysine residues in the γ ECD are not activated by trypsin3. It is therefore possible that while the α GRIP domain is cleaved, it is not directly involved in trypsin-mediated channel activation. Based on biochemical data, I speculate that the α GRIP domain is also cleaved by trypsin, but the GRIP domain is still clearly visible in our cryoEM maps. In any case, a lack of any observable channel rearrangement upon removal of the γ inhibitory peptide (a state in which ENaC’s PO approaches 0.9) must lead us to a deeper consideration of ENaC gating16.\n\nAlthough the best-studied mechanism of ENaC opening is GRIP proteolysis, multiple studies have found other stimuli which open the channel. The channel opens in response to laminar shear stress even with intact inhibitory peptides10,11,17. Phosphatidylinositol directly interacts with and opens the channel18–21. This process is mirrored by a rapid decrease in ENaC PO upon PKC activation, perhaps via allosteric modulation of phosphatidylinositol interactions22. ENaC PO is also sensitive to changes in both intracellular and extracellular pH23. It is thus possible that the cell possesses multiple mechanisms with which it can open ENaC, and uses some combination to tune Na+ permeability.\nThe possibility of a more complex pathway to open ENaC is supported by in vivo studies as well. The proportion of cleaved γENaC from mice lacking SGK1 is significantly smaller than that of WT mice, but cells from these kidneys have indistinguishable amiloride-sensitive current24. Similarly, ENaC missing the canonical furin cleavage site in the γ subunit is not cleaved when expressed in X. laevis oocytes, but currents do not differ between the mutant channels and WT25. Indeed, in different tissues and in different studies the cleavage of either α- or γENaC seems to be of greater importance, hinting at an environmental effect on the relationship between GRIP cleavage and channel PO16,26,27. Based on this prior research and the maps I present here, I suspect that ENaC gating is not as simple as the proposed mechanism in which a single, coordinated protein maturation step moves the channel from a low- to high-PO state28. However, I do not feel comfortable making firm conclusions about ENaC gating due to the unresolved question of the TMD.\nAs discussed in Chapter 3, the TMDs of all six models are disturbed and likely do not represent a physiological conformation. It is possible that the ECD requires some kind of feedback from the TMD, and that this coupling has been lost during purification and grid preparation. Mutations in linkers between the TMD and ECD of other channels have dramatic effects on ECD function; for instance, the lurcher mutation in the GluR1 ECD/TMD linker dramatically increases ECD affinity for glutamate29. I suspect that the ENaC ECD requires a fully-assembled six-TM pore region to respond to GRIP domain excision, but such a conclusion would require deeper investigation. A TMD/ECD decoupling would also explain the lack of ECD shift with the introduction of the DEG mutation, which has been shown to hold the channel in an open state, and for which I see dramatic TMD restructuring but no change in the ECD30. ENaC does not seem amenable to the standard means of membrane protein purification. It is possible that finding a more-stable homolog would improve the quality of the TMD, as our mouse maps have significantly better TMD density than our human maps.\n\n\n4.4.2 A role for the β9-α4 linker in gating\nIn Malacoceros fuliginosus FaNaC, a histidine in the β9-α4 linker forms contacts with both TMs31. This interaction blocks channel opening until ligand is bound. In ENaC, the equivalent residue is a tyrosine, as it is in Helix aspersa FaNaC, while in ASIC it is a tryptophan32. It is possible that any bulky or aromatic residue plays a similar ECD-lock role in this β-turn. In my models, only the β-subunit tyrosine is close enough to hydrogen bond with the TMs as I have modeled them, but this could be an artifact of the disordered TMD, or the interaction may be mediated by lipids.\nI also note that the proline directly preceding this tyrosine in both the β and γ loops (α does not have a proline in this loop) is in the cis conformation. This is true in both human and mouse ENaC, in all treatment conditions. Our previous models missed this conformer, likely because of significantly poorer resolution. ASIC’s tryptophan in this position is also preceded by a cis-proline2. In light of the important role this loop plays in FaNaC gating, and the conserved cis-Pro/aromatic pair in ASIC and ENaC, further investigation of this loop may prove fruitful.\n\n\n4.4.3 The acidic pocket’s uncertain role in sodium self-inhibition\nPrevious reports suggested that rearrangement of an acidic pocket in the α finger plays a key role in SSI6. It is therefore highly surprising that this pocket does not change upon release of Na+. However, there are species differences in ENaC SSI, and the functional work describing this acidic pocket was all performed on mouse ENaC, while our high- and low-Na+ models are both of human ENaC4,6,9. In human (but not rat) ENaC, pH titration changes the magnitude of SSI but, crucially, not the Ki of Na+; a surprising result if surface-accessible acidic residues form the SSI Na+-binding site. Moreover, ENaC cleavage essentially abrogates SSI, and residues in the upper finger which interact with the GRIP domain are implicated in SSI4,5,33. Despite this relationship, I also see no conformational shift of the acidic pocket upon trypsin treatment. It may therefore be that the acidic pocket simply has a higher affinity for Na+ than K+ and therefore presents a higher barrier to ECD conformational shift when bound to Na+. This would effectively trap the channel in a closed state, rather than some third sodium self-inhibited state. Without observing the complete gating cycle of ENaC and the concomitant conformational changes it is impossible to make any firm conclusions about the precise mechanism of SSI. I therefore hope that our models will serve as a useful guide in future studies on this acidic pocket, as well as a search for other potential sources of SSI.\n\n\n4.4.4 Glycans may further differentiate ENaC subunits\nThese maps represent the first structural study of ENaC’s extensive glycosylation. I must emphasize that these models all arise from particles which have only high-mannose glycosylation. However, glycosylation is required for ENaC function and trypsin digestion and our channels have the expected electrophysiological properties and respond to trypsin treatment in the expression system (Figure 4.11)10. I are therefore confident that the high-mannose glycans are sufficient for mechanistic inference.\n\n\n\nFigure 4.11: I/V curves for human CKO and CKO/DEG channels. Values are normalized per-cell to the inward current at -80 mV before trypsin treatment. Cells were treated with trypsin for five minutes before being re-recorded. Each point is the average of three cells. Error bars represent +/- one standard deviation.\n\n\nTwo distinct classes of glycan make observable interactions in our models: membrane-proximal and intersubunit glycans. I propose that the membrane-proximal glycans may help establish the micelle/nanodisc tilt observed in all ENaC maps to date, and that this tilt may have as-yet unknown functional implications. I do not believe that these glycans alone are sufficient to define ENaC’s orientation in the membrane, and note that in addition to missing a membrane-proximal glycan, γENaC has two fewer residues between the palm and TM1 than do the α or β subunits34.\nThe β intersubunit glycan interacts with the top of the α thumb, which may serve to rigidify it. Indeed, knock-out of β glycans protects the α subunit from trypsin digestion10. Perhaps the β intersubunit glycan holds the α subunit in a pose which primes it for proteolytic cleavage. In contrast, the γ palm, not thumb, is rigidified by the other large intersubunit glycan. I note also that previous observation of channels cleaved by endogenous cellular machinery indicated that removal of the inhibitory peptide reduces the map quality for γ- but not αP3 and P47.\nThis alternate rigidification is interesting in the light of sodium self-inhibition. As yet, there is not a clear explanation for how mutating αH255 and γH233 (occupying the same structural position in their respective subunits) might have opposite effects on SSI (augmenting and eliminating it, respectively)35. Considering a rigid macro-domain comprising the uncleavable β subunit, γ palm, and α thumb (connected via glycans) and a flexible macro-domain comprising the α palm and finger and γ thumb, I see that γH233 belongs to the former, while αH255 belongs to the latter. Of course, more functional study is required to firmly establish this link, but I note that the SSI of channels lacking N-linked glycosylation sites is significantly reduced compared to WT10.\n\n\n\n\n\n1.

    "text": "A.2 ENaC Purification\n\nA.2.1 Human ENaC\nThroughout this protocol, quantities of resin and buffer are given “per flask”. I grow cell culture in quantities of 800 mL culture per flask, meaning that, e.g., pelleted cells from 1.6 L of cells require twice the quoted quantities of buffer and resin. In datasets with NaCl listed as the salt, solubilization buffer, wash buffers, elution buffer, and SEC buffer used NaCl in place of KCl.\nTo purify ENaC, frozen whole-cell pellets were removed from the -80 °C freezer and thawed in a 37 °C water bath. While the pellets were thawing, 50 mL Solubilization Buffer was prepared per flask:\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl\n1 tablet per 100 mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n25 U/mL ThermoFisher universal nuclease\n2.5 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2\n10 mg/mL digitonin\n10 μM amiloride\n\nThe solubilization buffer was prepared fresh at 2x concentration (i.e., half the final volume). Once pellets were fully thawed, they were added to the solubilization buffer and the mixture was brought to the final volume with DI water and poured into a screw-cap bottle. The solubilization mixture was left at 8 °C for 1.5 hours.\nAfter solubilization was complete, the crude lysate was decanted into ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 45 minutes at 4 °C.  Meanwhile, in-house-made GFP-nanobody CNBr resin (0.8 mL per flask) was loaded into an XK 16 column and washed with 2 CV of TBK\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n\nand the following buffers were prepared in the listed quantities:\nwash A (10 column volumes [CV]):\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 mM MgCl2\n2 mM ATP\n2 nM phenamil\n\nwash B (10 CV):\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n5 mM CaCl2\n2 nM phenamil;\n\nelution buffer (5 CV): wash B with 33 μg/mL thrombin\nThe column was washed with 2 CV of wash A, then clarified lysate was bound to the column under 4 mL/min flow. A small aliquot of pre-column and post-column clarified lysate was reserved to assess binding efficiency by GFP FSEC1. If binding efficiency fell below 90% of the initial efficiency the resin was discarded. Otherwise, it was regenerated with pulsed pH cleaning. The GFP-nanobody column was washed with 5 CV wash A and B.\nTo elute ENaC from the GFP nanobody resin, the column was washed 3 times with 1.5 CV elution buffer and once with TBK with 0.7 mg/mL digitonin. As each wash was flowed on, the eluant was collected in 1 mL or 0.25 CV fractions, whichever was smaller. This results in four sets of fractions: the first comprises largely wash B with little protein (from the initial flow-on of elution buffer), and the remaining three elution buffer. All fractions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and fractions with bands at the expected molecular weight for ENaC were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5 mL. If the preparation was acid-shocked, the protein was desalted into acid shock buffer at this stage:\n\n20 mM Tris pH 6\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 nM phenamil\n\nIf the preparation required Fabs, they were added in two-fold excess of protein concentration (as determined by nanodrop A280) at this stage. A final concentration of 1 mM C8 PIP2 was added to the CKO/DEG monofab samples just before grid preparation.\nThe concentrated eluant was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in SEC buffer for further purification via SEC.\n\n20 mM Tris pH 7.5\n200 mM KCl\n0.7 mg/mL digitonin\n2 nM phenamil\n\nSEC was typically run overnight, meaning fractions remained at 4 °C until the next morning. Fractions from the SEC peak were collected and assayed for purity and monodispersity by SDS-PAGE and tryptophan FSEC. Monodisperse peaks were pooled and used the same day. Thus, total time between cell pellet thaw and protein use was typically less than 36 hours.\n\n\nA.2.2 Mouse ENaC\nFrozen cell pellet was thawed on ice. Membranes were prepared by sonication and centrifugation, then re-frozen until purification. For each gram of membranes, 15 mL of solubilization buffer was added\n\n4 mM GDN\n20 mM HEPES pH 7.6\n150 mM NaCl\n2 mM ATP\n2 mM MgSO4\n1 mM TCEP\n100 μM amiloride\n1 tablet per 100 mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n\nMembrane pellet was mixed thoroughly and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer. Cell pellet was stirred for 1  hour at 4 °C. Solubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 45 minutes at 4 °C.\nNext, 300 μL GFP nanobody CNBr resin per gram of membrane was loaded into a gravity column and washed with 10 CV HBS\n\n20 mM HEPES pH 7.6\n150 mM NaCl)\n\nand 3 CV wash A\n\n0.1 mg/mL GDN\n20 mM HEPES pH 7.6\n150 mM NaCl\n1 mM TCEP\n100 nM phenamil\n\nClarified lysate was flowed over this column under gravity. The column was washed with 6 CV each of wash A, wash B (wash A with 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgSO4), wash C (wash A with 25 U/mL ThermoFisher Universal Nuclease), and elution buffer (wash A with 5 mM CaCl2). ENaC was eluted by flowing 1 CV of elution buffer with 30 μg/mL thrombin onto the column and collecting the supernatant. After an hour, this process was repeated. These elution steps were repeated for a total of four elutions of 1 CV each.\nThe first three elutions were pooled and concentrated to 0.5 mL. Fab was added at a one-to-one ratio with nominal protein concentration by nanodrop. Sample was incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature, then centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 20 minutes at 4 °C. The clarified sample was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in fresh wash A buffer. Fractions were assessed for purity via SDS-PAGE and FSEC before proceeding to grid preparation or other uses."

To this suspension, 1 mL TBS was added to prepare a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/mL.\nLipids, ENaC, and MSP2N2 were mixed at a final MSP:POPC:ENaC molar ratio of 1:31:0.04. The final concentration of MSP2N2 was kept at 100 μM by further concentrating ENaC or adding lipid reconstitution buffer with 35 mM DM as necessary. This reconstitution mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour. During this incubation, biobeads were washed once in 100% methanol, three times in water, and once in TBS. After 90 minutes, 215 mg washed biobeads per 1 mL reconstitution mixture were added. After 1 hour, the reconstitution mixture was moved to a fresh aliquot of equilibrated biobeads and left nutating overnight at room temperature, approximately 16 hours. The reconstitution mixture was pipetted off the biobeads, filtered with a 0.2 μm filter, and purified via SEC using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column in TBS. Typical yields were extremely low, between 5–10% of input ENaC. The protein assembly was stable with minimal aggregation at 4 °C (assessed by cryoEM and SEC) for at least two weeks."

    "section": "A.7 cryoEM Image Processing",
    "text": "A.7 cryoEM Image Processing\nEach dataset was processed slightly differently, but following the same general pipeline. First, movies were imported into cryoSPARC for pre-processing. Default parameters were used for both motion correction and CTF estimation. Next, particles were picked using the blob picker in cryoSPARC. Adjustments were made to the minimum and maximum radii to account for the number of Fabs present in each sample. Blob picks for several micrographs were manually inspected and adjusted. First, the NCC parameter was adjusted until few contaminant and carbon-edge picks remained. Next, in a low-defocus micrograph, the low power threshold was adjusted to remove empty ice picks. Finally, in a high-defocus micrograph, the high power threshold was adjusted to remove all carbon-edge and contaminant picks. These initial blob picks were cleaned by 2D classification, and the resulting particle sets used to generate templates for template picking. Template picked thresholds were adjusted as for blob picked particles.\nThe template picked particles were repeatedly 3D classified using heterogeneous refinement in cryoSPARC, providing one “good” class and a number of “junk” classes (typically noisy or bad ab initio models of the blob picked particles) until all particles produced reasonable ENaC classes. The final particle set was never 2D classified, since I find that 2D classification reduces the frequency of rare particle views. From this point, processing proceeded ad hoc to produce the final maps (Image Processing).\n\n\n\nFigure A.1: S2C2 pixel sizes seem miscalibrated. A: Scaling the nominal pixel size for human CKO/DEG dramatically increases the correlation with human CKO digitonin. B: Correlation coefficients for all maps. Maps were aligned prior to taking correlation coefficients. Abbreviated as follows: hCKO: human CKO; hCD-MF: human CKO/DEG monofab; mTrypsin: trypsin-cleaved mouse; hCKO/DEG: human CKO/DEG difab; hCKO-ND: human CKO nanodisc; mUncleaved: mouse uncleaved; mJanelia2: a second uncleaved mouse dataset collected at Janelia, but not presented here.\n\n\nDuring image processing, I began to suspect that the pixel sizes provided by S2C2 are likely miscalibrated. First, other users reported pixel size calibration issues with S2C2 microscopes around the time these datasets were collected (Patrick Mitchell, S2C2 Director of Operations, personal communication). Second, scaling the CKO/DEG difab pixel size from the nominally-correct 0.43 to 0.414 (a change of approximately 3.6%) changes the map correlation value from 0.72 to 0.93 (Figure A.1 A). Finally, a comparison of the correlation between seven recently-collected ENaC maps shows that S2C2 is an outlier, with unscaled maps generated from data collected at PNCC and Janelia Farm correlating better with themselves and each other than with those collected at S2C2 regardless of construct (Figure A.1 B). I therefore decided to scale both S2C2 maps to correlate best with the same condition and construct recorded at PNCC after processing was complete. I present the models built into the scaled maps in this work."

The amino acid sequences for mENaC α (Uniprot ID Q61180), β (Uniprot ID Q9WU38), and γ (Uniprot ID Q9WU39) were joined using 10xGS linkers between α and β, and β and γ. This meta-sequence was then entered as the AlphaFold target. The linkers and large, unstructured, low-confidence loops were removed from the model before proceeding.\nBefore docking into experimental maps, starting models had Fabs and waters deleted to ease early model building steps. Initial models were rigid-body fitted into the experimental maps. Any loops in poor or missing regions of the map were deleted. The whole models were simulated with distance restraints using ISOLDE and ChimeraX4,5. Once models were roughly fit into the potential, strained distance restraints were released. Once the backbone appeared to fit reasonably well into the map, all distance restraints were released. Simulating one chain at a time, a pass over every residue in ENaC was performed, focusing on Ramachandran values and rotamers. Once all chains had been optimized in this manner, glycans were added using Coot’s carbohydrate module6. Fabs were rigid-body fitted and simulated similarly to the initial models once these steps were complete.\nModels were refined using Phenix real-space refinement7. In some cases, the TMD map was used as-is for refinement. In other cases, the ECD and TMD map were combined using Phenix’s “Combine Focused Maps” job and the resulting map was used for refinement. In these cases, the lowest GSFSC resolution was provided to Phenix. Parameters were left as default, except rotamers were only refined when they had both poor map quality and were outliers (rather than or). I changed this setting because rotamer and clash statistics were significantly worse if it was left as the default. Model quality was assessed using MolProbity within Phenix, Q-scores calculated in ChimeraX, and 3DFSC as implemented in cryoSPARC (Table A.4 and Appendix C)8–10."

Additionally, all human channels are “cysteine knock-out” (CKO) mutants, with the following mutations: αC63A, βC30A, and γC33A C41A. Some (but not all) cysteines in the ENaC TMD are known to be palmitoylated11–13. CKO channels express at approximately eight times the yield of wild-type-like channels, with similar electrophysiological traits. Mouse channels presented in this work have no mutations from the consensus gene. I expect mouse and CKO channels to be closed.\nDEG channels have two mutations: βS520K and αT240W. The former mutation at what has been named the “DEG site” holds the channel in an open state regardless of proteolytic cleavage state14. The DEG site sits in the TMD just above the predicted amiloride-binding site. The latter mutation in α lies in the GRIP domain and also increases the PO of uncleaved ENaC15."

Each salt solution also had a counterpart with 100 μM amiloride added. Finally, a trypsin solution (KCl external solution with 5 μg/mL trypsin) was prepared.\nAmiloride sensitive current was determined by placing a cell in the amiloride external solution for 1 second, the amiloride-free solution for 2 seconds, and returning to the amiloride solution for 1 second. Average current during no-amiloride traces was subtracted to set the baseline to 0 A, and the maximum current during the 2 second no-amiloride duration taken as the amiloride-sensitive current. The K+ recordings show a current spike when returning to the amiloride-containing solution, which I exclude from the calculations. This process was performed once for each holding potential between -80 and +80 mV, stepping by 20 mV. Then, this entire voltage sweep was repeated for each of the two remaining salts. The cell was then exposed to the trypsin solution for 5 minutes, and the entire set of voltage and salt sweeps repeated for the post-trypsin measurements. Thus, the full combination of voltage, salt, and proteolytic cleavage states was recorded on each cell. Once a dish had been exposed to the trypsin solution, the dish was replaced with a fresh dish and coverslip to prevent early cleavage of unmeasured cells."

    "section": "D.1 Appia",
    "text": "D.1 Appia\nModern structural biology makes extensive use of size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). The two types of SEC I encountered most often were analytic chromatography, in which samples are assessed for monodispersity and relative amount; and preparative chromatography, in which samples are purified based on their size. In an environment where only a heuristic assessment of these parameters is important (e.g., assessing whether a sample is homogeneous enough to make grids of, or whether a protein interacts with another) these parameters can be assessed by eye (Figure D.1). However, chromatography instrument manufacturers must include capacity for more complex analyses in their software. This necessarily makes the software more complex and arcane in the service of features that biochemists rarely need. To solve this mismatch I created Appia, a web-based chromatography visualization package1. In this section I will provide a brief summery of Appia’s functionality and intended use, the installation process, and then some guidance for adding support for new chromatography instruments.Appia can be installed via pip, or the source can be inspected at my github.\n\n\n\nFigure D.1: Heuristic chromatography parameters are easily assessed by eye. Users can approximate affinity for the stationary phase (size, in the case of SEC), quantity, homogeneity, and the number of distinct species by inspecting peak shifts, peak height, peak width, and number of peaks respectively.\n\n\n\nD.1.1 Structure\nAppia is divided into two conceptual parts: the local processor and the web interface. The local processor is written entirely in python and processes all supported data formats into a unified Appia experiment. Several options are available at processing time, such as applying a scaling factor for various manufacturers or automatic trace plotting. Additionally, the local processor includes a user settings system. This system stores information such as flow rates to apply to a specific chromatography method and database login information. Experiments, to Appia, are collections of analytic and preparative traces. Importantly, Appia is agnostic as to the origins of the data in a single experiment — experiments may contain traces from any number of manufacturers and/or instruments, provided Appia has a processor for that manufacturer. The experiments are stored on the local machine in both long (appropriate for ggplot2 and other grammar-of-graphics plotting systems) and wide (appropriate for, e.g., Excel or Prism) formats (Figure D.2). These experiments are packaged with an experiment ID and uploaded to the other half of Appia, Appia Web.\n\n\n\nFigure D.2: Data formats saved by Appia and available for user download. Traces made up of individual samples (A) are represented as a single row in the long format (B). The wide format (C) instead represents the independent variable with its own column (Time, red), the response variable with the table body (Signal, white), and all other variables in column headers (various colors).\n\n\nAppia Web provides a browser-based GUI and centralized trace database. The database is a CouchDB database containing a simple dictionary of experiments stored under their experiment IDs. The browser-based GUI is written in python and plotly dash, and loads user-requested data from the database and presents it using a series of line plots. Analytic data is presented with one line per sample per channel, while preparative data is presented as a single line per injection with fractions highlighted by fill. Analytic data is also presented with a normalization applied, such that the maximum of each trace is 1 and the minimum is 0. The user may select a region of the analytic traces and re-normalize them to set the maximum over that range to 1, scaling the rest of the trace linearly (Figure D.3). This normalization process is intended to aid in comparison of relative peak heights between different samples which may have a different total amount of material, or to compare peaks within a trace compared to some standard peak height. Importantly, this process uses the simple readout of peak height. More complex analyses or analyses requiring quantitative accuracy are outside the scope of Appia and should use manufacturer-provided peak calling and fitting. Users can also download images and raw data from Appia Web.\n\n\n\nFigure D.3: Appia’s normalization process. A user-selected region is used to linearly scale all traces such that their maximum value over that region is 1.\n\n\n\n\nD.1.2 Installation\nAppia can be used solely to locally process chromatography data into a standard format for later plotting. However, we recommend installing a processing installation on each instrument computer and a single centralized Appia Web installation on some networked computer. This allows for single-click processing and upload of data to a central repository which users can then inspect, manipulate, and download from their personal computers without installing Appia. To facilitate this process, I have created Docker images for Appia Web. Images are available for both x86-64 and ARM architectures, and docker-compose templates are available in the project repository. Running one of these templates creates and networks the database and Appia Web automatically, requiring only that the user expose the correct ports (5984 for CouchDB and 8080 for Appia Web).\nBelow is an example process for installing Appia Web on a Windows PC which is accessible at example.ohsu.edu:\n\nInstall docker desktop\nDownload install-appia-web_pc.ps1 and run it. Provide the desired configuration information\nRun docker-compose up -d\nEnsure that ports 5984 (database) and 8080 (web interface) are accessible\n\nThe Appia Web interface would now be available at example.ohsu.edu:8080/traces. All that is left is installing the processor on the instrument computer, a much simpler process:\n\nInstall python\nRun python -m pip install appia\nRun appia utils --database-setup and provide the information set up during Appia Web installation.\n\nNow when a user finishes a chromatography experiment, they first export it to whatever format Appia expects (typically the default text format) and run (assuming the files end in .txt) appia process *.txt -d to upload the data to the web interface. The files will automatically be organized and stored on the local computer as well. This command can be wrapped in a script to avoid the need for users to interact with the command line.\n\n\nD.1.3 Peak fitting with Gaussian Mixture Models\nOne useful form of analysis that Appia cannot perform on its own, but that can be performed with Appia’s data output, is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In GMMs, we (perhaps obviously) treat our signal as a mixture of pure gaussian processes. This is especially useful when analyzing chromatography of species with known retention times. For instance, suppose that we know that a Fab binds a target, which shifts the target’s retention time from 10 minutes to 9.8 minutes. The Fab’s retention time is well outside this region, perhaps at 24 minutes, and so we can ignore unbound Fab. If we mix these proteins and look at the signal around 10 minutes, we might observe a peak like Figure D.4. We want to know what proportion of the target has shifted to the 9.8 minute retention time, since that will tell us how much has bound. However, it’s impossible to tell this by looking at the data, or even by using manufacturer-written peak integrating algorithms. However, since we know the retention times of each component, we can model the mixture ourselves. I’ll work this example in R, but it could just as easily be done in python, Matlab, or whatever modeling software the reader prefers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.4: Example data of a mixture between a protein and a Fab.\n\n\n\n\nGaussian curves have two components: the mean and the standard deviation. In a chromatography context, the mean is the retention time and the standard deviation the monodispersity of the peak (i.e., its width). We also need to model the amount of the component, which we can model with a simple scalar for each component.

To see how well the data have been fit, we can plot each component separately, or their sum, as in Figure D.5.\n\n# helper function to extract values\nget_val &lt;- function(val_name) {\n    coef(results)[[val_name]]\n}\n# function generator for the gaussians\nplot_gauss &lt;- function(scale, mean, sd) {\n    \\(x) scale * dnorm(x, mean = mean, sd = sd)\n}\nfit_unbound &lt;- plot_gauss(\n            get_val('ub_amount'),\n            ub_rt, get_val('ub_sd')\n        )\nfit_bound &lt;- plot_gauss(\n            get_val('b_amount'),\n            b_rt, get_val('b_sd')\n        )\n\ndata_plot + \n    geom_function(\n        fun = fit_unbound,\n        color = 'blue',\n        linetype = 'dotted',\n        n = 1000,\n        linewidth = 1\n    ) +\n    geom_function(\n        fun = fit_bound,\n        color = 'forestgreen',\n        linetype = 'dotted',\n        n = 1000,\n        linewidth = 1\n    ) +\n    geom_function(\n        fun = \\(x) fit_unbound(x) + fit_bound(x),\n        color = 'black',\n        n = 1000\n    )\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.5: Fitted values plotted atop data. Bound and unbound are green and blue respectively, with the additive model in black.\n\n\n\n\nWe see the data fit well — we now have a model for the components of our experiment. To assess, for instance, the amount of protein in each peak, we could from here use the well-known equations for the area of a gaussian to find the peak area for each population, or just take their height as a heuristic. If this simple sum of gaussians model does not fit, you could consider adding a constant (for a constant non-zero baseline) or parameters for a linear function (for a linearly changing baseline) to the fit formula.\n\n\nD.1.4 Writing a new processor\nThis section is intended for the advanced reader who wishes to add support for a chromatography instrument to Appia.\nProcessors are each a class which inherits from either HplcProcessor or FplcProcessor (for analytic or preparative data, respectively). At the time of writing, Appia supports the following data formats:\n\nWaters Empower .arw files\nShimadzu .asc files\nShimadzu .txt files\nAgilent .csv files\nCytiva/GE .csv files\n\nYour processor can perform any necessary setup in __init__(), but it must eventually run\nsuper().__init__(\n    filename,\n    manufacturer = {appropriate_string},\n    **kwargs\n)\nWhen Appia processes files, for each file, it creates an instance of every Processor child. These Processors all decide whether they can process a file using their claim_file() method, which you must implement. This method should accept a filename and return True if the processor thinks that is a type of file it can process and False otherwise. For instance, here is WatersProcessor.claim_file():\n@classmethod\ndef claim_file(cls, filename) -&gt; bool:\n    return filename[-4:].lower() == '.arw'\nIt simply checks whether the file ends in .arw. Depending on the data format for the new manufacturer, the method may require more complex checks, or you may have to add more specificity to other claim_file() methods.\nIf your processor claims the file, it will automatically run two methods: prepare_sample() and process_file(). The distinction between these is arbitrary, as they are both always run in sequence. It is intended that prepare_sample() collects metadata about the sample (method name, flow rate, sample set name, etc.) and process_file() creates the actual data frame. The data frame must be in the long format, should be stored in your processor’s df attribute, and should have exactly the following column names:\n\nmL: the retention volume in mL.\nTime: the retention time in minutes.\nSample: the sample name.\nChannel: the signal channel. Values in this column are arbitrary but should follow some kind of internal logic.\nNormalization: whether this row is normalized (“Normalized”) or raw (“Signal”).\nValue: the y-axis position for this row.\n\nAt this point, your Processor is done. As long as only one Processor claimed a file, the Appia parser will handle concatenation, plotting, and upload for you.I would encourage you to write a test as well, of course.\nThe parent classes provide a few conveniences for you. For example, the flow_rate and column_volume getters will prompt the user for the relevant info, if necessary, and then offer to store it in the user settings. It will also handle overrides of various parameters, which are accepted through kwargs. Additionally, appia.processors.core provides the normalize() function, which handles trace normalization. I encourage you to take a look at the Processors I’ve already written before embarking on writing your own."

They’re all available on my github.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.6: An image from ca_bilder.py highlighting the movement of the finger and thumb between the resting and desensitized states of ASIC1.\n\n\nca_bilder.py creates a .bild file visualizing Cα shifts between two given models. Cylinders are drawn between each pair of Cα atoms, colored by the distance. The colors are scaled per-model, with the darkest color corresponding to the greatest shift. The models must be aligned before they are run through the script. If the models are multi-chain, cylinders will be drawn between the same chain ID. If the models are of two different proteins, you must provide a FASTA alignment and indicate which chain belongs to which sequence. These visualizations can be useful to highlight when certain domains move while others stay still, such as ASIC1’s gating cycle (Figure D.6).\ncheck_for_glyc.py searches a PDB model for the sequence NXS/T, the canonical N-linked glycosylation sequence. All asparagines matching this requirement are added to a ChimeraX command HTML file. Opening this file with ChimeraX creates a list of clickable asparagine names. Clicking these links orients the camera on the appropriate residue and removes the link from the list, creating a checklist of sorts. If the model and map are both open, this is a convenient way to step through all potential glycosylation sites in a model and assess whether they are indeed glycosylated. The user may then add sugars via the normal commands.\nmodel_map.py, orientation_plotter.py, phenix-table-reader.py, and the three R scripts all read information from PHENIX or 3DFSC output and produce more aesthetically appealing plots. phenix-table-reader.py is a convenient way to automatically update a Table 1 (for instance, Table A.4) during the model building process. Output from the other scripts can be seen in Appendix C.\nmutator.py checks the sequence of a model against a FASTA sequence and alerts the user to any mismatches. It also creates a ChimeraX command file which can be run to mutate the model to match the FASTA file. Any known deviations can be passed to the script as a .txt file with one mutation per line in a ChimeraX-like format. For instance, if chain A has a C→K mutation at position 260, the .txt file should have a line reading /A:C260K.\ntranslator.py is currently ENaC specific, but could be generalized by a user. It is a simple script to translate residue numbers between the same gene of different organisms using a FASTA file. It is mostly useful when reading or writing and trying to incorporate data from multiple organisms. An example of this script in use:\n$ translator.py mA260\nMouse αK260 =&gt; Human αK233\nAt time of writing, PHENIX adds waters to a seemingly random chain (perhaps based on proximity?) and with a number overlapping other residue numbers. This makes analysis extremely frustrating, since waters have the exact same atom specifier as other residues and are spread over the chains. water_fixer.py solves this problem by reading through a PDB file and moving all waters to chain H and numbering them starting at 1. This has the unfortunate side effect of waters not being numbered in a spatially coherent way, but it’s better than nothing.\n\n\n\n\n1. Posert, R., and Baconguis, I. (2023).
