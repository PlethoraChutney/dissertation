+It's impossible to acknowledge everyone who contributes to something like a PhD, and I won't attempt to do so.
+I will, however, mention people without whom and places without which I can be certain I would not have finished this whole thing.
+
+First, my partner, Lindsey.
+My life is brighter and my path easier because you're in it.
+
+Next, my dearest friends.
+I received some excellent advice when I was interviewing at graduate schools: "You only applied to places where the science interested you, and is of good quality. Now pay attention to the people who are here with you. You'll be spending six years with them."
+I decided to come to OHSU (which was *not* where I heard that advice) because I felt I could build a warm, kind, and supportive community here.
+I was right.
+So here is that community, presented in a computationally-randomized order.
+
+I think I would have chased a more "prestigious" school without Tuck's guidance, and for that and everything else, I am ever grateful.
+
+Ryan, what more is there to say after a literal dozen years of friendship. Thank you for being a steadfast companion, always willing to lend an ear or crack a window.
+
+Casey and Ryan, you both mean the world to me and we miss you in Portland. I try to embody your Manic Host Energy whenever I'm entertaining. See you at thanksgiving.
+
+Varchas, one of my favorite memories from the past six years is coming out into the dining room and seeing an empty box of Hi-Chews next to you at 6:30am, followed by an hour-long education in Indian politics. I cherish you.
+
+Madeleine, what a joy it is to experience a conversion from "friend's partner" to "friend". I know I can rely on you and confide in you, and I hope you feel the same for me. Thank you for encouraging me to reach, and for pushing me over the finish line. See you at Vida.
+
+John, not sure how you made it in this list. Can I still edit this?
+
+Nigel, it's hard to make friends as an adult but you make it easy.
+
+Sam and Becca (aka The Pod), you helped me survive 2020 and thrive since. Thank you for agreeing with me about Lindsey's pronunciation of \begingroup{}\symbolfont/tʃeɪz ˈlɒ̃ɡ/\endgroup{}.
+
+Thank you to Noah and Caz and especially Emlyn for some of the greatest Monday nights dice can dream of.
+
+Alexis, you inspire me to keep trying new things and to trust I can learn to be creative.
+
+Britt, the chaos you bring out in me is almost certainly good for me. Probably. I eagerly await your next midnight update on the home datacenter.
+
+Gaelen, my number one hype man. I'm waiting in the wings to get you out the door too. I'm glad I tricked you into staying in Portland.
+
+Liz, come on back to the West Coast. I'm glad you followed the science you're interested in, but I'm happier you're coming back.
+
+Of course, to get a PhD in a lab science, you do unfortunately have to do some lab work.
+I did not enjoy this, but it was made bearable by my wonderful lab mates, Sigrid, Alex, and James.
+I also want to thank Nate, Zad, and Johannes from the Gouaux lab for helping me learn both how to do science and how to work in a high-pressure environment.
+Sarah, too, deserves some accolades for being an early guinea pig for me figuring out how to teach people cryoEM.
+
+My cat, Nooch, certainly made this more difficult if anything, but it feels appropriate to at least mention her.
+
+I consider myself lucky that as I approached a committee meeting I was more anxious about making Jonathan, Swetha, Dave, and Steve proud than about how they'd treat me.
+Thank you all for your kindness and guidance.
+Steve deserves special mention for helping me through the last year or so of the process and making sure I never read *too* deeply into my garbage TMD maps.
+
+Finally, thank you to Shoofly and Honey Latte, where I wrote my dissertation and defense seminar.
+All told, it took me $624.43 of coffee, pastries, and breakfast burritos to write this document.

+# ENaC - An Overview {.unnumbered}
+
+Structural biology is ultimately the study of particular domains and residues, but this knowledge most interesting and useful in the context of physiological processes.
+As such, it can be difficult to order the chapters of an introduction.
+Placing the structure before the function grounds discussion of mutations and disease, but leaves the structure unmoored from biomedical relevance.
+Conversely, placing function first leaves the reader without a clear understanding of which domains are important for which reasons, which is vital for a focused discussion of the protein.
+
+To dodge the question of which is the cart and which is the course, I present here an exceedingly brief (and less heavily cited) discussion of ENaC structure and function.
+Everything covered here is covered in more detail in the Introduction.
+ENaC biology is discussed in @sec-intro_physiology, while details on the ENaC/DEG family and ENaC structure can be found in @sec-intro_as-a-channel.
+
+## A bit of ion channel terminology
+
+Ion channels are essential components of cellular life, present in everything from bacteria on up to humans.
+The minimal ion channel spans the lipid bilayer and allows ions to flow through a pore down their concentration gradient.
+We can measure the flow of ions through a single channel as a current (called the *unitary current*).
+
+However, most ion channels have some mechanism by which the flow of ions can be controlled.
+We thus say an ion channel can be "open" or "closed", i.e., it can allow ions to flow through itself or not.
+This process is called *gating*, and is most often controlled by either voltage (voltage-gated ion channels) or some ligand (ligand-gated ion channels).[ENaC is a bit unique in that the ligand is a part of the channel itself, but that's beside the point]{.aside}
+
+We can further quantify a channel's "openness" by how much time it spends in the open state vs. the closed state.
+A channel with an *open probability* (P~O~) of 0.75 spends approximately 75% of its time in the open state and 25% of its time in the closed state.
+
+Open probability and unitary currents are both properties of *single channels*.
+Groups of channels (for instance, all of the channels in a cell) do not have a measurable P~O~, since the group will not be homogeneous.
+
+For instance, say there is a collection of 100 ion channels.
+Twenty of those channels are bound to ligand, and seventeen of those channels are open.
+Eighty channels are not bound to ligand, and twenty-two of those channels are open.
+Do we only consider the ligand-bound channels, making the P~O~ $\frac{17}{20}$?
+Or maybe we should consider only the apo channels, making it $\frac{22}{80}$?
+Or perhaps we consider the whole population: $\frac{39}{100}$?
+Or is it maybe the mean P~O~ of both groups,  $\frac{\frac{17}{20} + \frac{22}{80}}{2}$?
+
+In practice, we'd probably describe this set of 100 channels as two populations: the open population with a P~O~ of 0.85 and the closed population with a P~O~ of 0.275.
+Ligand binding would move a channel from the closed to the open population, and ligand dissociation would move it back to the closed population.
+
+Typical electrophysiology experiments measure the *macroscopic current*: how many ions flow through all of the channels of a given type in a cell.
+This is represented as *I*, with the current due to a particular ion, e.g., sodium as *I~Na^+^~*.
+Ion channels are often selective for a particular ion or set of ions.
+For instance, a sodium-specific ion channel will allow Na^+^ but not other ions through, while a cation-selective channel will allow Ca^2+^ and K^+^ but not Cl^-^.
+Macroscopic current is affected by the number of channels in each gating state, the P~O~ of those states, the unitary current of the open channels, and the number of channels in the membrane (*N*).
+Further review is available from Hille or Ackerman and Clapham [@hille2001; @ackerman1997].
+
+## The ENaC/DEG family
+
+The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is, perhaps obviously, a member of the ENaC/DEG family of ion channels.
+These channels are trimeric, pass cationic currents, are voltage-insensitive, and are inhibited by the small molecule amiloride (and its derivatives).
+Amiloride blocks current through ENaC/DEG channels by binding a surface in the extracellular to the selectivity filter and blocking the pore.
+
+The overall topology of these channels is similar, with the greatest sequence (and, presumably, structural) diversity found in the distal ECD (furthest from the membrane).
+Current structural study suggests a conserved overall gating mechanism as well.
+
+Aside from ENaC, the best-studied members of the ENaC/DEG family are the eponymous degenerin (DEG) channel and the acid-sensing ion channel, ASIC.
+DEG is expressed in *C. elegans* and is involved in mechanosensation.
+ASIC is expressed in a variety of organisms (including humans) and opens in response to acidic extracellular conditions.
+ASIC has by far the best-described structure of the family.
+
+
+## ENaC Structure
+
+![An overview of ENaC structure. Everything except the TMD is collectively called the ExtraCellular Domain (ECD).](introduction/figures/domain-cartoon/enac-overview.png)
+
+ENaC is a triheteromeric ion channel comprising three subunits, the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits.[For most figures in this document, I color the &alpha; subunit blue, the &beta; subunit red, and the &gamma; subunit magenta.]{.aside}
+Each subunit shares an overall similar topology, and so I describe them here without reference to a specific one.
+
+The transmembrane domain, or **TMD**, contains the pore and selectivity filter.
+The extracellular domain, or **ECD**, contains domains important for regulating open probability (P~O~) and other functional characteristics.
+There are also short intracellular N- and C-terminal tails which regulate surface expression.
+
+The ECD is further subdivided into six domains, named after the parts of a hand.
+The **palm** and **&beta;-ball** form a rigid backbone and make the plurality of the contacts with the other subunits.
+The **knuckle**, **finger**, and **thumb** likely move during channel gating and contain important glycosylation sites.
+
+The **GRIP** domain is unique to ENaC.
+ENaC opens when the GRIP domain is excised from the channel.
+The canonical proteases responsible for channel opening are: furin, which cuts the &alpha; subunit twice and &gamma; subunit once; and prostasin, which cuts the &gamma; subunit again.
+
+![An exaggerated model of ENaC opening. **Left**: an uncleaved subunit. **Right**: after GRIP is removed from the channel, the finger and thumb collapse together, pulling the TMD away from the pore axis and opening a fenestration.](../figures/other/opening-model.png)
+
+Removal of the GRIP domain is thought to allow the finger and thumb to collapse together.
+This movement is coordinated with movement of the palm away from the pore axis, which in turn opens a fenestration just above the membrane.
+Ions enter at this fenestration and pass down a pore formed by the second transmembrane helix, TM2.
+
+Along this pore, ions larger than sodium are filtered out by size.
+It is thought that this selectivity filter is formed by a three-residue loop connecting swapped domains of TM2, but an un-swapped conformation is also possible.
+
+The above summary of ENaC's presumed gating mechanism is based largely off cross-linking electrophysiology studies and ASIC's well-described gating mechanism.
+In ASIC, protons allow for finger/thumb collapse (recall that ASIC does not have a GRIP domain).
+However, ASIC rapidly desensitizes and ENaC does not.
+
+## ENaC Function and Regulation
+
+The regulation and function of ENaC in the body is not entirely understood, but broadly, ENaC functions as the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption in tissues which express it.
+Thus, control of ENaC expression also controls water retention and reabsorption in those tissues.
+
+![Function and regulation of ENaC in the kidney. Each component is covered in more detail in @sec-regulation, but the essential observation is that ENaC is the rate-limiting step in sodium reabsorption.
+](introduction/figures/kidney-cartoon/kidney-cartoon.png)
+
+ENaC is best studied in the kidney, where it plays a pivotal role in blood pressure regulation.
+When the kidney detects reduced blood pressure, it initiates a cascade which results in increased circulating levels of the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone.
+Aldosterone increases overall expression of ENaC, the proportion of ENaC at the cell surface, and the proportion of channels which are open (i.e., have an excised GRIP domain).
+For more detail on aldosterone and ENaC regulation in the kidney, see @sec-intro_aldosterone.
+
+:::{.content-visible unless-format="docx"}
+![Aldosterone](/figures/aldosterone.svg){.aside}
+:::
+
+Cells with more ENaC at the surface allow more sodium to pass from the lumen to the interstitial fluid.
+This in turn results in increased water retention, thus raising blood volume and pressure.
+
+Since the channel is activated primarily by proteolysis, ENaCs cannot close again once opened.
+Open channels are tagged for retrieval from the plasma membrane and degradation via ubiquitination on the N-termini each of the three subunits.
+Additionally, ENaC is sensitive to membrane composition and requires PIP~2~ to open.
+
+This is, I believe, enough of a background to move on to a full introduction of the topics covered in the remaining document.
+The reader is also encouraged to check the glossary for unfamiliar terms and abbreviations.

 From there, I move into a discussion of current knowledge about ENaC's structure/function relationships.
 Finally, I provide a brief overview of proteins which directly modify ENaC's electrophysiological properties (rather than expression levels, which are covered in @sec-regulation).
 
+## ASIC
+
+ENaC is a member of the ENaC/DEG superfamily of sodium-selective ion channels.
+These ion channels share a common ancestor as far back as Cnidaria and, as their long evolutionary history might imply, fill a wide variety of roles in the organisms that express them [@aguilar-camacho2023].
+The structures of ENaC/DEG family members solved so far also hold to a common topology: the ion channels are trimeric, with large extracellular domains, two transmembrane helices per subunit, and short intracellular tails.
+
+The member of this family of which we have the greatest structural understanding is the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC).
+All of the gating states of this channel have been solved, and a great deal is known about its gating mechanism and the conformational changes associated with channel opening, desensitization, and closing.
+Since existing functional study of ENaC suggests similar conformational changes, most researchers assume that the conformational changes associated with ENaC's gating mechanism will be similar.
+In this section I provide the reader with a brief introduction to ASIC and important similarities and differences between it and ENaC.
+
+The ASICs are themselves a family of ion channels, and the properties of each channel differ slightly from the others.
+There is also evidence that different ASIC proteins can form heterotrimeric ASIC channels.
+However, the only ASIC for which we have structural information is ASIC1a, and so I refer to that channel as ASIC for the rest of this document.
+I will explicitly refer to the ASIC family as necessary.
+
+### Gating
+
+![An overview of ASIC's gating mechanism. The channel starts in a resting state (top), with a de-protonated acidic pocket. This conformation holds the finger and thumb apart. When a proton bonds, the channel enters the open state (bottom right). Collapse of the finger and thumb causes conformational shifts of the palm and TMD, opening the fenestration and allowing the channel to pass current. The channel rapidly desensitizes (bottom left). The palm and TMD return to a closed conformation, while the finger and thumb remain protonated and in the same conformation as the open state.](figures/asic-mech/asic-mechanism.png){#fig-intro_asic-mechanism}
+
+ASIC's gating cycle involves three states: resting, open, and desensitized (@fig-intro_asic-mechanism).
+ASIC opens when its extracellular domain is exposed to acidic solution, with a half-maximum activation at pH 5.8 [@hesselager2004].
+This peak current then desensitizes with a time constant of 0.64 &mdash; a marked difference from ENaC currents, which do not desensitize.
+
+![ASIC's acidic pocket. Protonation of the acidic pocket collapses the finger and thumb, which propagates to an opening of the fenestration. **Left**: an overview of ASIC, with the acidic pocket highlighted. **Right**: a stereo view comparison of the acidic pocket between resting (grey, 5WKV) and open (white, 4NTW) states. Note that, once protonated, Asp 238 moves 7&nbsp;&Aring; to form interactions with the thumb.](figures/acidic-pocket-residues/acidic-pocket-residues.png){#fig-intro_asic-acidic-pocket}
+
+Protons open the channel by binding an acidic pocket located between the finger, thumb, and &beta;-ball domains (@fig-intro_asic-acidic-pocket).
+Binding of protons to titratable residues in this pocket result in the collapse of the finger and thumb.
+This collapse is in turn propagated through the thumb and palm to the TMD, which rotates and translates about the pore axis (@fig-intro_asic-mech-distances).
+This movement opens a fenestration just above the cell membrane, through which ions enter the pore (@fig-intro_asic-fenestration).
+
+![A diagram of ASIC's gating conformational changes. When resting ASIC (grey)are protonated (white), the finger and thumb collapse (right).

+
+The pore is lined by the second transmembrane helix from each subunit.
+Approximately two-thirds of the way down the pore, the helix breaks and short loop connects a domain swap to the adjacent TM2 helix (@fig-intro_asic-gas-belt).
+This loop, called the GAS belt due to its one-letter code sequence, forms the selectivity filter of ASIC.

+
+Unlike ENaC, ASIC desensitizes.
+Rapidly upon opening, a short loop in ASIC's palm flips to a desensitized conformation, which decouples the ECD and TMD.
+Thus, the ECD remains proton-bound and open, while the TMD returns to a closed conformation and obstructs the fenestration, preventing ions from passing through.

+# The Graveyard {#sec-graveyard}
+
+In this appendix, I will go into more detail on experiments that did not work, or that did not produce interpretable results.
+I will also discuss dead ends on the protein purification pathway to guide future efforts.
+This section is isolated from the main body of the text since it is only interesting to those who may follow after me.
+As such, a basic familiarity with lab protocols is assumed.
+
+## Nedd4-2
+
+Early on, my work included purification of Nedd4-2 with an eye toward both a functional assay for Nedd4-2/ENaC interaction and a structure of the bound complex.
+Nedd4-2 comprises structured domains connected by disordered linkers, and so it should come as no surprise that this proved too difficult and time consuming and was dropped [@pohl2021; @joshi2022].
+However, it may be that adding Nedd4-2 helps to resolve ENaC's TMD and even regions of the intracellular loops, so future research into the topic may yet prove fruitful.
+
+### Expression and purification
+#### Insect cells and TALON
+
+Nedd4-2 was initially expressed in Sf9 cells as a C-terminal GFP fusion.
+Cells were infected at an MOI of 5 and left to express protein at 21&nbsp;&deg;C for 48&nbsp;hours.
+Cells were collected via centrifugation (100k&nbsp;xg for 45&nbsp;minutes) and frozen in liquid nitrogen until use.
+
+Cells were thawed and resuspended in 100&nbsp;mL TBS per flask, then sonicated for a total of 5&nbsp;minutes of 10&nbsp;seconds on, 30&nbsp;seconds off, power level&nbsp;7.
+Crude lysate was centrifuged for 45&nbsp;minutes at 100,000&nbsp;xg and clarified lysate collected.
+
+Clarified lysate was bound to 10&nbsp;mL TALON resin per flask and washed with 5&nbsp;CV TBS followed by 2&nbsp;CV TBS plus 10&nbsp;mM imidazole.
+Finally, 1&nbsp;mL fractions are collected from a 4&nbsp;CV elution with 250&nbsp;mM imidazole.
+These fractions are concentrated and sized on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (@fig-graveyard_nedd4-purification).
+The SEC protocol for Nedd4-2 is essentially unchanged from that for ENaC (@sec-matmeth_human-enac-purification), with the exception that TBS alone (i.e., without detergent) is used as a running buffer.

+        y = "Fluorescence (AFU)"
+    )
+```
+
+There are several problems with this protocol.
+First, tagging a Nedd4-family ligase on its C-terminus renders it completely non-functional.
+This is probably why yield is so high and pure --- the protein is incapable of affecting itself or the cell in any way.
+Second, most of the field uses material prepared from *E. coli*, and it's generally best to follow convention.
+Finally, Nedd4-2 harbors a cryptic thrombin site, so GFP cleavage also cleaves the protein.
+
+#### *E. coli* and strep tags
+
+I thus moved to expression of strep-tagged material in *E. coli*.
+The Nedd4-2 gene was cloned into pJAC148 and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells.
+At OD~600~&nbsp;0.75, expression was induced with 250&nbsp;&mu;M IPTG and transferred to a 16&deg;C incubator and allowed to express overnight.
+Cells were pelleted and frozen with liquid nitrogen.
+
+Following a standard strep purification protocol, the material looks significantly worse than that purified by IMAC (@fig-graveyard_twinstrep-n42).
+I believe this is most likely due to the fact that this material is actually functional, which means it is capable of self-degradation.
+It also likely puts the *E. coli* cells under significantly more stress than non-functional material.
+
+![Twin-strep purification of Nedd4-2 expressed in *E. coli*. **Top**: SEC trace of twin-strep purified material. Indicated fractions are further analyzed by SDS-PAGE. **Bottom**: SDS-PAGE analysis of the indicated fractions. Note that only fractions 18 and 19 contain Nedd4-2.](figures/graveyard/Exp88-neddprep.png){#fig-graveyard_twinstrep-n42}
+
+This material, obviously, contains a large leading peak centered around 11&nbsp;mL.
+Since there seems to be no protein at all in this peak, but it is after the void volume, I suspect it is nucleotide contamination.[I do not have A~260~/A~280~ measurements for this material, unfortunately]{.aside}
+In any case, this protocol seemed the most reliable means by which I could purify large amounts of (potentially) active Nedd4-2.
+
+### ENaC Binding
+
+The Nedd4-2 purified from both Sf9 cells and *E. coli* binds ENaC.
+A simple, single-replicate experiment shows increased movement of GFP-tagged Nedd4-2 from its unbound peak to a peak eluting before ENaC (@fig-graveyard_nedd42-bindings).
+This is, of course, not an entirely rigorous experiment.
+Most concerning is the fact that increased ENaC does not always translate to an increase in the presumptive Nedd4-2 bound ENaC species.
+
+```{r nedd4-2_binding}

+
+### Ubiquitination assay
+
+If this project had progressed, we would have needed a way to assess whether our purified Nedd4-2 was functional or not.
+My idea for this was an *in vitro* ubiquitination assay.
+Ideally, we'd take tagged ubiquitin (Ub), an E1, an E2, and our purified Nedd4-2 and incubate them together.
+Next we'd detect ubiquitination of ENaC via western blot.
+Only the mixture with all of these components should have ubiquitinated ENaC.
+
+I made a few attempts at this, and none of them really worked.
+It's not worth reproducing the exact protocols here &mdash; for the truly interested reader, they are in Lab Meetings 2, 3, and 4.
+The two major categories I tried were what I'd call a "minimal" or "supplementary" ubiquitination assays.
+
+The minimal assay involved purchasing an *in vitro* ubiquitination kit and replacing the company's E3 enzyme with the same molar amount of my purified Nedd4-2 (as assayed by nanodrop).
+Using this assay I was potentially able to detect a moderate amount of ubiquitination of ENaC (@fig-graveyard_exp78-wb).
+However, overall signal is low, and there appears to be some ENaC-Ub signal in lanes without purified Nedd4-2.
+Additionally, longer incubation times do not result in stronger ENaC-Ub signal.
+I take it from this assay that our purified material was not functional.
+
+![A western blot of the minimal *in vitro* ubiquitination assay. The **left blot** is against &gamma; ENaC; the **right blot** is against a FLAG tag present on the ubiquitin used during the assay. Purified ENaC and Nedd4-2 are used in combination with commercial Ube1 and Ube2 along with the FLAG Ub as indicated in each lane. Note that minimal movement of ENaC out of the expected bands is observed on the left, and little accumulation of signal is seen on the right.](figures/graveyard/Exp78_labeled_bw_WB.png){#fig-graveyard_exp78-wb}
+
+However, my western blots are never great, and it may be that refinement of the detection technique is required.
+For instance, another of my blots for the minimal assay did seem to show some ubiquitination by our purified Nedd4-2 (@fig-graveyard_exp88-wb).
+Regardless, this inconsistency means the assay needs work in addition to whatever work needs doing on Nedd4-2 and ENaC themselves.
+
+![**Left**: A western blot against ENaC &gamma;. The high molecular weight band is ENaC in the stacking gel. **Right**: quantification of the upper, middle, and lower bands (B01, 02, and 03 respectively). Note that as B01 increases, B02 decreases.](figures/graveyard/Exp88-WB.png){#fig-graveyard_exp88-wb}
+
+For a supplementary assay, I add purified Nedd4-2 to rabbit reticulocyte lysate.
+The idea was to check for increased ubiquitination when more E3 enzyme is added.
+I never ended up running this assay because it made less sense than the minimal assay, and I abandoned Nedd4-2 before I could get to it.
+
+### What should be done?
+If I were starting over, I'd find a good positive control to make sure we could test the function of our Nedd4-2.
+That the purified Nedd4-2 is much more important than that it binds ENaC.
+Next, an assessment of the necessary ratios and concentrations for stable complex formation would be useful.
+I expect that some form of cross-linking would be required to guarantee complex formation on the grid without overcrowding.
+
+Ultimately, though, I think I was right to abandon this facet of my project.
+The domains of Nedd4-2 have already been resolved, and it seems to be largely unstructured aside from those domains.
+Rather than rely on it to help align the intracellular and transmembrane domains, I would try a megabody or other scaffolding system.
+
+## Scintillation Proximity Assay {#sec-graveyard_spa}
+
+As discussed in @sec-results_spa, SPA never worked for anybody in our entire lab, working across three proteins.
+As a reminder, our main problem was that specific and non-specific counts were essentially indistinguishable.
+
+Ideally, non-specific counts increase linearly and specific counts increase logarithmically with increasing substrate, and signal-to-background ratios should be around 1.5 [@harder2012].
+Our background and "specific" counts both increased linearly with more substrate, leading me to believe that our "specific" counts are merely unaccounted-for background.
+Additionally, our signal-to-background ratio typically falls between 0.2 and 0.01 (one to two orders of magnitude too low).
+Finally, our "specific" counts are often negative.
+
+If you're saying to yourself, "Well then it just seems like your protein isn't binding the ligand at all" I'd agree with you.
+I don't think playing around the edges here will fix anything.
+It is worth noting that the same exact trends occur in ASIC, which we know has a properly-folded TMD by cryoEM.
+This indicates that there is likely something fundamentally wrong with our process, rather than (or, more likely, in addition to) something wrong with our purified ENaC.
+
+### BSA
+
+It's fairly common practice to include additives to reduce non-specific binding in SPA assays.
+We tried BSA, which is typically added at around 5%.
+Surveying a number of percentages around there yields no improvement in background or specific counts (@fig-graveyard_spa-bsa).
+
+![Addition of BSA does not improve SPA results. **Left**: ENaC held at a constant concentration with increasing proportion of BSA added shows no improvement in specific counts.](figures/graveyard/spa-bsa.png){#fig-graveyard_spa-bsa}
+
+Changing the acidity of the mixture, alongside the pH, does not improve background or specific counts (@fig-graveyard_spa-bsa-ph).
+I also include this plot to show that specific counts are, more often than not, negative.
+
+![Changing the pH of the mixture from 7.4 to 6.0 does not improve counts, and specific counts are often negative. Lines follow the mean for each condition.](figures/graveyard/Exp124-spa.png){#fig-graveyard_spa-bsa-ph}
+
+### Data collection time
+
+The time at which data are collected changes the result (@fig-graveyard_spa-timeline).
+Counts are recorded from a plate, and the amount of incubation required to reach a steady signal must be determined empirically.
+However, with low specific counts, the selection of recording time can dramatically change the interpretation of results.
+
+![The plate is re-recorded approximately every 10 minutes. Note that high ligand concentrations (upper facets) maintain a steady signal, while low ligand concentrations (lower facets) are too noisy to reliably determine. Thus, datasets recorded only 10 minutes apart might show dramatically different Specific (Experimental - Control) counts for low concentrations, which would significantly affect fitted K~d~ values. Note, also, that despite their stability, specific counts at high ligand concentrations are almost entirely negative.](figures/graveyard/Exp137_all-counts.png){#fig-graveyard_spa-timeline}
+
+### Membrane memetic
+
+Switching from digitonin to nanodiscs yields a marginal improvement in that specific counts are generally positive (@fig-graveyard_spa-nanodiscs).
+However, specific counts still increase linearly with ligand concentration well beyond the reported K~d~ of ENaC for benzamil (approximately 10&nbsp;nM), calling into question whether they are truly specific.
+Additionally, the signal-to-background ratio remains below 1.0.
+
+![SPA data collected from nanodiscs does not result in better specific counts or lower total counts. Bars represent the standard error of the mean for three replicates, but are too small to see in the higher-concentration plots.](figures/graveyard/Exp144_01-all-counts-timecourse.png){#fig-graveyard_spa-nanodiscs}
+
+### Bead type
+
+Use of nanoSPA's smaller, lower-background beads does improve total counts, i.e., reduces the background counts (@fig-graveyard_nanospa-background).
+It is, however, extremely important to note here that **none of the samples in this experiment had any ENaC**.
+There thus **cannot be** any specific counts &mdash; there is no protein for benzamil to bind!
+It is thus very concerning to me that the counts in this experiment follow the same trend as our proper, ENaC-containing experiments, with low but present "specific" signal.
+
+![Comparison of nanoSPA and Perkin Elmer (PE) beads. In this context, "background" and "total" differ only in that "background" does not have any detergent added and "total" does. Note that nanoSPA beads quickly level off to a steady signal while PE beads increase for several hours. Note also that "specific" counts, which should be zero in all cases, are lower in nanoSPA beads than PE. Bars represent the standard error of the mean for three replicates, but are too small to see in the higher-concentration plots.](figures/graveyard/Exp148_01-all-counts-timecourse.png){#fig-graveyard_nanospa-background}
+
+Along this line, addition of ENaC nanodiscs to the nanoSPA bead mixture does not elicit any increase in counts, or even any noticeable difference from the ENaC-less experiment (@fig-graveyard_nanospa-enac).
+
+![nanoSPA beads with ENaC added. Bars represent the standard error of the mean for three replicates, but are too small to see in the higher-concentration plots.](figures/graveyard/Exp158_01-all-counts-timecourse.png){#fig-graveyard_nanospa-enac}
+
+### What should be done?
+
+In my opinion, nothing.
+This assay is a dead end, or at least requires much more work than the more promising flux assay.
+
+I personally also would like to note that, despite how it is used in several labs at OHSU, SPA is fundamentally a *binding assay*.
+It *does not* provide any information about whether an ion channel is capable of passing currents, let alone the specificity of those currents.
+As such, it is not truly a functional assay.
+Spending more time working on an assay that doesn't even tell us what we need to know seems like a lose-lose to me.

 I reproduce them in the first section of this chapter in case they are ever of interest.
 Perhaps of more value will be the following sections in which I cover experiments that produced no valuable results so that future researchers do not retread the same ground.
 
+## Constructs
+
+To tackle the problem of the ENaC TMD, I solved the structure of six different combinations of condition and construct.
+These conditions are summarized in @tbl-human-constructs, but I will present them in greater detail here, along with their models.
+In addition to the mutations I discuss here, all human constructs had the canonical furin sites knocked out: &alpha;R178A, R204A and &gamma;R138A.
+It was our hope that knocking out furin sites would lead to a more defined ECD composition by preventing our expression system from cleaving the ECD.
+
+It is important to note that the described mutations were only applied to the human constructs we discuss.
+All mouse models are wild-type (with the exception of a few residues left from cleavage of GFP off the &gamma; subunit).
+
+### Cysteine Knock-Out
+
+![The CKO model.](figures/constructs/cko.png){#fig-results_cko}
+
+The cysteine knock-out (CKO) mutant had four C&rarr;A mutations: &alpha;C63A, &beta;C30A, and &gamma;C33A,C41A (@fig-results_cko).
+We mutated these positions because some (but not all) intracellular cysteine residues are known to be palmitoylated [@mukherjee14; @mueller10; @mueller12].
+
+We wondered if previous difficulty in solving the structure of the TMD may have been the result of aberrant palmitoylation, given that ENaC in our expression system exists at far higher concentration than would exist in a typical cell.
+CKO mutants did indeed express at higher levels than WT, and their peaks on SEC appeared more homogeneous.
+
+### DEG
+
+![The CKO/DEG model.](figures/constructs/cd-difab.png){#fig-results_cd-difab}
+
+The DEG mutation replaces serine 520 in human ENaC with the equivalent lysine from *C. elegans*'s DEG channel.
+This mutation keeps the channel in an open state regardless of whether the GRIP domain is cleaved or not [@snyder2000].
+In channels to which we apply the DEG mutation, we also apply a mutation in the GRIP domain which reduces the affinity of the channel for its inhibitory  peptide, &alpha;T240W [@kashlan2010].
+
+The DEG and GRIP mutations were applied to a background of human CKO channels.
+We thus call these channels, which we expect to be constitutively open, CKO/DEG channels (@fig-results_cd-difab).
+
+### Acid-shock
+
+For two maps (CKO digitonin and CKO/DEG difab), I briefly "shocked" the material by desalting it into a pH 6.0 solution (as opposed to our typical purification pH of 7.4).
+I did this to test if poorly-folded material from internal membranes might be more susceptible to cashing out in less-favored conditions.
+I did not end up detecting any difference in either the final yield, the yield before and after acid-shock, or the map quality.
+I therefore discontinued this practice after these two maps.
+
+### PIP~2~
+
+![The CKO/DEG monofab PIP~2~ model.](figures/constructs/cd-monofab.png){#fig-results_cd-monofab}
+
+As discussed in @sec-intro-phospholipids, ENaC requires PIP~2~ to open.
+I thus added 1&nbsp;mM C8 PIP~2~ to the CKO/DEG monofab samples just before grid preparation (@fig-results_cd-monofab).
+I did not notice any difference in TMD quality or conformation compared with the CKO/DEG difab map (which did not have PIP~2~ added), and so did not add the lipid to any other preparations in this work.
+
+### Nanodiscs
+
+![The CKO nanodisc model. Note that I was not able to resolve any features in the TMD.](figures/constructs/cko-nd.png){#fig-results_cko-nd}
+
+ENaC seems to interact significantly with the membrane (@sec-intro-membrane).
+I thus wondered if making grids with protein in lipids, as opposed to detergent, might improve the map quality.
+I thus solved a map of CKO protein in nanodiscs composed of POPC to test this hypothesis (@fig-results_cko-nd).
+
+This map had the worst TMD density of any of the conditions I tested.
+My nanodisc prep had very low yields (approximately 5%), and so there may be some issue that causes the material to unfold during nanodisc reconstitution.
+Another possibility is that the nanodisc is more ordered than a micelle, and so dominates the alignment of the TMD, blurring out TM helices.
+
+It is possible that other lipid combinations or reconstitution pipelines might improve results.
+This could be a promising avenue for future research, but I did not pursue that here.
+
+We had also been concerned that our use of Fabs might make it difficult or impossible to align our particles to the TMD, or that they may be changing the conformation of the ECD in some way.
+This protein preparation therefore did not include either of the fabs we use to break pseudosymmetry.
+Using the extensive ECD glycosylation I was still able to break pseudosymmetry, but did not detect any differences with and without Fabs (discussed more in @sec-results_ecd).
+
+### Mouse ENaC and trypsin
+

 The CKO mutations do increase ENaC yield, but their theoretical underpinning is not sound at all.[Recall that CKO channels have the following mutations in addition to protease site knockouts: &alpha;C63A, &beta;C30A, and &gamma;C33,41A]{.aside}
 Channels with either one of &gamma;C33A and/or &gamma;C41A exhibit reduced P~O~ and increased SSI compared with wild type despite no change in surface expression [@mukherjee14].

 I have identified several glycans which, based on their extended visibility in my maps, may serve a structural role.
 We also know, as covered in @sec-intro_mechano, that glycans are necessary for sensation of laminar shear stress.
 Electrophysiological studies of ENaCs with single asparagine mutations have not been performed by any lab, to my knowledge.
-Using my maps as a guide, it may be fruitful to investigate the sensitivity of ENaCs lacking the most visible (and, therefore, most stable) glycans to LSS.
+Using my maps as a guide, it may be fruitful to investigate the sensitivity of ENaCs lacking the most visible (presumably the most structurally constrained) glycans to LSS.
 
 Additionally, the FaNaC paper raises an interesting question: is the bulky residue in the &beta;9-&alpha;4 linker necessary for proper gating?
 Conservation of the surrounding residues and an adjacent *cis*-proline would suggest so.
 An investigation of this loop is interesting whether the channels can gate or not &mdash; the best kind of experiment.
 
+## Conjecture
+
+What do I think should be done next, if I'm so smart?
+
+### We need a functional assay
+
+Why doesn't our channel seem to undergo structural changes when it's sodium self-inhibited?
+Why can't we see our TMD?
+Why doesn't the GRIP domain release from the ECD when it's cleaved?
+All of these questions and more are essentially unanswerable without knowing *whether our channels are functional in the first place*.
+All of the mysterious observations from my work are fully satisfied by the conjecture that *we're looking at misfolded garbage*.
+
+As such, my first priority moving forward would be the development and implementation of a functional assay.
+As I discussed in @sec-graveyard_spa, the SPA assay shows no sign of working any time soon, and isn't even truly a functional assay.
+
+The sodium flux assay is, on the other hand, already halfway to usefulness.
+Using a known-good ion channel (ASIC comes to mind, but any sodium-specific ion channel will do) would help push it to completion by isolating the "protein is good" variable from the "assay works" variable.
+With more confidence in the fact that our purified material has some bearing on what is present in the cells, we can move back to structural study.
+
+### Find a better construct for the TMD
+
+As discussed in @sec-tmd_abandon-cko, the CKO and DEG mutations should both be abandoned.
+They never made sense in the first place, and they did not accomplish their stated goals of stabilizing the TMD and holding the TMD and ECD in open states, respectively.
+Returning to a wild-type-like construct will make our results more interpretable.
+
+To find a satisfactory gene for further study, we should first perform thermo-FSEC assays on a wide range of ENaC orthologs[In this context, a thermo-FSEC assay is the typical FSEC assessment of particle homogeneity with the added step of heating a sample from 4 through 90&nbsp;&deg;C. Essentially, measuring peak height degradation with increasing temperature is used as a proxy for temperature stability.]{.aside}.
+Thermal stability, like SPA, is not an assay for function.
+It is, however, high-throughput, and channels which are stable are more likely to remain functional once purified.
+
+I would then take the most-stable 10% of these constructs and perform whatever functional assay we end up developing on all of them.
+Any gene with significant flux could be screened using the same cryoEM concentrations and grid parameters I've determined in this work.
+We thus know we'd be starting with the most functional, most stable material we can find, rather than picking genes at essentially random as was done previously.
+Any promising maps could have their purification and grid parameters refined while simultaneously performing proper electrophysiological studies to ensure selectivity and currents are within reason.
+
+One potential objection to this method is that we do not know whether our symmetry-breaking Fabs will bind to all forms of ENaC.
+My response is two-fold.
+First, it is easy to determine this during the high-throughput thermo-FSEC experiments by adding a condition with Fabs and looking for a shift.
+Second, my Fab-less nanodisc dataset demonstrates that &lt;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&Aring; maps can be achieved without the use of Fabs.
+
+Moreover, solving maps just to solve maps is pointless.
+Fabs bind tightly and predictably to human and mouse ENaC, and look where that got us.
+
+### There are other interesting regions of the channel
+
+I think it was a mistake for me to focus exclusively on the TMD.
+Instead, there are exciting mutations in the ECD with described functional consequences that we already have map.
+For instance, mutation of a disulfide in the &alpha; subunit palm (&alpha;C479) results in Liddle syndrome, and we have high-quality map density for both halves of this disulfide (@fig-conclusion_disulfide).
