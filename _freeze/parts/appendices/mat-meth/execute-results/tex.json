Freestyle medium with 2% FBS at a density of 2 &ndash; 4$\\times 10^6$ cells/mL.\nBacMam virus carrying the genes for the appropriate ENaC subunits were added to the flasks at an MOI of 1 and incubated at 37&nbsp;&deg;C for 8 hours, after which 1 &mu;M amiloride was added and the flasks were moved to 30&nbsp;&deg;C.\nAfter a total incubation time of 72 hours, cultures were centrifuged at 4,790 xg for 20 minutes to collect pellets.\nThe pellets were washed with **TBS** (20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;8.0, 200&nbsp;mM NaCl) and centrifuged again before snap-freezing in liquid nitrogen.\nCell pellets were stored at -80&nbsp;&deg;C until use.\n\n### Mouse ENaC\n\nSf9 cells were grown in suspension in Sf900-II serum-free media at 27&nbsp;&deg;C.\nCells were infected at log phase with virus encoding full-length mouse ENaC~&alpha;~, ENaC~&beta;~, and ENaC~&gamma;~.\nAfter 5&ndash;6 hours of growth, 1&nbsp;&mu;M amiloride was added to the culture.\nCells were harvested 24&nbsp;hours later, washed with TBS, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80&nbsp;&deg;C until used.\n\n## ENaC Purification\n\n### Human ENaC\n\nThroughout this protocol, quantities of resin and buffer are given \"per flask\".\nI grow cell culture in quantities of 800&nbsp;mL culture per flask, meaning that, e.g., pelleted cells from 1.6 L of cells require twice the quoted quantities of buffer and resin.\nIn datasets with NaCl listed as the salt, solubilization buffer, wash buffers, elution buffer, and SEC buffer used NaCl in place of KCl.\n\nTo purify ENaC, frozen whole-cell pellets were removed from the -80&nbsp;&deg;C freezer and thawed in a 37&nbsp;&deg;C water bath.\nWhile the pellets were thawing, 50&nbsp;mL **Solubilization Buffer** was prepared per flask:\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;7.5, 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 1 tablet per 100&nbsp;mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n * 25 U/mL ThermoFisher universal nuclease\n * 2.5&nbsp;mM ATP, 5&nbsp;mM MgCl~2~\n * 10&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin\n * 10 &mu;M amiloride\n\nThe solubilization buffer was prepared fresh at 2x concentration (i.e., half the final volume).\nOnce pellets were fully thawed, they were added to the solubilization buffer and the mixture was brought to the final volume with DI water and poured into a screw-cap bottle.\nThe solubilization mixture was left at 8&nbsp;&deg;C for 1.5 hours.\n\nAfter solubilization was complete, the crude lysate was decanted into ultracentrifuge tubes and centrifuged at 100,000 xg for 45 minutes at 4&nbsp;&deg;C.\n<!-- TODO: where did I get the GNB gene? -->\nMeanwhile, in-house-made GFP-nanobody CNBr resin (0.8&nbsp;mL per flask) was loaded into an XK 16 column and washed with 2&nbsp;CV of TBK\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;7.5\n * 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n\nand the following buffers were prepared in the listed quantities:\n\n**wash A** (10 column volumes [CV]):\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;7.5, 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 0.7&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin\n * 2&nbsp;mM MgCl~2~\n * 2&nbsp;mM ATP\n * 2&nbsp;nM phenamil\n\n**wash B** (10&nbsp;CV):\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;7.5\n * 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 0.7&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin\n * 5&nbsp;mM CaCl~2~\n * 2&nbsp;nM phenamil;\n\n**elution buffer** (5&nbsp;CV): wash B with 33 &mu;g/mL thrombin\n\nThe column was washed with 2&nbsp;CV of wash A, then clarified lysate was bound to the column under 4&nbsp;mL/min flow.\nA small aliquot of pre-column and post-column clarified lysate was reserved to assess binding efficiency by GFP FSEC[@kawate06].\nIf binding efficiency fell below 90% of the initial efficiency the resin was discarded.\nOtherwise, it was regenerated with pulsed pH&nbsp;cleaning.\nThe GFP-nanobody column was washed with 5&nbsp;CV wash A and B.\n\nTo elute ENaC from the GFP nanobody resin, the column was washed 3 times with 1.5&nbsp;CV elution buffer and once with TBK with 0.7&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin.\nAs each wash was flowed on, the eluant was collected in 1&nbsp;mL or 0.25 CV fractions, whichever was smaller.\nThis results in four sets of fractions: the first comprises largely wash B with little protein (from the initial flow-on of elution buffer), and the remaining three elution buffer.\nAll fractions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and fractions with bands at the expected molecular weight for ENaC were pooled and concentrated to a final volume of 0.5&nbsp;mL.\nIf the preparation was acid-shocked, the protein was desalted into **acid shock** buffer at this stage:\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;6\n * 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 0.7&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin\n * 2&nbsp;nM phenamil\n\nIf the preparation required Fabs, they were added in two-fold excess of protein concentration (as determined by nanodrop A~280~) at this stage.\nA final concentration of 1&nbsp;mM C8 PIP~2~ was added to the CKO/DEG monofab samples just before grid preparation.\n\nThe concentrated eluant was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in **SEC buffer** for further purification via SEC.\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM Tris pH&nbsp;7.5\n * 200&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 0.7&nbsp;mg/mL digitonin\n * 2&nbsp;nM phenamil\n\nSEC was typically run overnight, meaning fractions remained at 4&nbsp;&deg;C until the next morning.\nFractions from the SEC peak were collected and assayed for purity and monodispersity by SDS-PAGE and tryptophan FSEC.\nMonodisperse peaks were pooled and used the same day.\nThus, total time between cell pellet thaw and protein use was typically less than 36 hours.\n\n### Mouse ENaC\n\nFrozen cell pellet was thawed on ice.\nMembranes were prepared by sonication and centrifugation, then re-frozen until purification.\nFor each gram of membranes, 15&nbsp;mL of **solubilization buffer** was added\n\n * 4&nbsp;mM GDN\n * 20&nbsp;mM HEPES pH&nbsp;7.6\n * 150&nbsp;mM NaCl\n * 2&nbsp;mM ATP\n * 2&nbsp;mM MgSO~4~\n * 1&nbsp;mM TCEP\n * 100&nbsp;&mu;M amiloride\n * 1&nbsp;tablet per 100&nbsp;mL Pierce EDTA-free protease inhibitor tablets\n\n\nMembrane pellet was mixed thoroughly and homogenized with a Dounce homogenizer.\nCell pellet was stirred for 1&nbsp; hour at 4&nbsp;&deg;C.\nSolubilized membranes were centrifuged at 100,000&nbsp;xg for 45&nbsp;minutes at 4&nbsp;&deg;C.\n\nNext, 300&nbsp;&mu;L GFP nanobody CNBr resin per gram of membrane was loaded into a gravity column and washed with 10&nbsp;CV **HBS**\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM HEPES pH&nbsp;7.6\n * 150&nbsp;mM NaCl)\n \n and 3&nbsp;CV **wash A**\n \n * 0.1&nbsp;mg/mL GDN\n * 20&nbsp;mM HEPES pH&nbsp;7.6\n * 150&nbsp;mM NaCl\n * 1&nbsp;mM TCEP\n * 100&nbsp;nM phenamil\n\nClarified lysate was flowed over this column under gravity.\nThe column was washed with 6&nbsp;CV each of wash A, **wash B** (wash A with 2&nbsp;mM ATP, 2&nbsp;mM MgSO~4~), **wash C** (wash A with 25 U/mL ThermoFisher Universal Nuclease), and **elution buffer** (wash A with 5&nbsp;mM CaCl~2~).\nENaC was eluted by flowing 1&nbsp;CV of elution buffer with 30&nbsp;&mu;g/mL thrombin onto the column and collecting the supernatant.\nAfter an hour, this process was repeated.\nThese elution steps were repeated for a total of four elutions of 1&nbsp;CV each.\n\nThe first three elutions were pooled and concentrated to 0.5&nbsp;mL.\nFab was added at a one-to-one ratio with nominal protein concentration by nanodrop.\nSample was incubated for 10&nbsp;minutes at room temperature, then centrifuged at 100,000&nbsp;xg for 20&nbsp;minutes at 4&nbsp;&deg;C.\nThe clarified sample was loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) equilibrated in fresh wash A buffer.\nFractions were assessed for purity via SDS-PAGE and FSEC before proceeding to grid preparation or other uses.\n\n## ENaC nanodisc preparation\n\nTo prepare nanodiscs, 15&nbsp;mg of a chloroform stock of POPC (Avanti) was dried down under an argon stream.\nThe lipid film was left overnight in a vacuum desiccator to remove all chloroform.\nThe lipids were then resuspended in 350 &mu;L **reconstitution buffer**\n\n * 20&nbsp;mM HEPES pH&nbsp;7.4\n * 100&nbsp;mM KCl\n * 1&nbsp;mM EDTA\n\nand sonicated until the solution was milky in appearance and no lipids remained adhered to the sides of the tube, typically 5--10 minutes.\nTo this solution, 150 &mu;L of 350 &mu;M DM in reconstitution buffer was added.\nThe resulting 500 &mu;L suspension was sonicated in 5 minute bursts until completely clear.\nTo this suspension, 1&nbsp;mL TBS was added to prepare a final lipid concentration of 10&nbsp;mg/mL.\n\nLipids, ENaC, and MSP2N2 were mixed at a final MSP:POPC:ENaC molar ratio of 1:31:0.04.\nThe final concentration of MSP2N2 was kept at 100 &mu;M by further concentrating ENaC or adding lipid reconstitution buffer with 35&nbsp;mM DM as necessary.\nThis reconstitution mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 hour.\nDuring this incubation, biobeads were washed once in 100% methanol, three times in water, and once in TBS.\nAfter 90 minutes, 215&nbsp;mg washed biobeads per 1&nbsp;mL reconstitution mixture were added.\nAfter 1 hour, the reconstitution mixture was moved to a fresh aliquot of equilibrated biobeads and left nutating overnight at room temperature, approximately 16 hours.\nThe reconstitution mixture was pipetted off the biobeads, filtered with a 0.2 &mu;m filter, and purified via SEC using a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 column in TBS.\nTypical yields were extremely low, between 5--10% of input ENaC.\nThe protein assembly was stable with minimal aggregation at 4&nbsp;&deg;C (assessed by cryoEM and SEC) for at least two weeks.\n\n## Western Blots\n\nSDS-PAGE gels were blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes.\nMembranes were blocked in 50&nbsp;mg/mL milk in TBST for 1&nbsp;hour at room temperature.\n<!-- TODO: get lot number for gamma antibody -->\nPrimary antibody (**ENaC~&alpha;~**: Santa Cruz Biotechnology &alpha;ENaC (H-95) sc-21012 lot no. L2812; **ENaC~&gamma;~**: abcam Anti-epithelial Sodium Channel gamma ab133430) was added to this same blocking buffer at 10&nbsp;&mu;g/blot and incubated overnight at 4&nbsp;&deg;C.\nMembranes were washed 3&nbsp;times with TBST for 5&nbsp;minutes before addition of secondary antibody (LI-COR IRDye 800 CW Goat anti-Mouse 925-32210 lot no. D21115-21) in TBST.\nMembranes were incubated at room temperature with secondary for 1&nbsp;hour, washed 3&nbsp;times with TBST and once with TBS, then imaged (LI-COR Odyssey DLx).\n\n## cryoEM Grid Preparation\n\nGrid preparation different slightly for each dataset, but followed the same general procedure (@tbl-model-building).\nPurified GFP-cleaved ENaC was concentrated for grid preparation just before blotting and freezing.\nAll grids were glow discharged at 15 mA for 60 seconds on a Pelco easiGlow before blotting.\nGrids were frozen using a Vitrobot Mark III (Thermo Fisher).\nVitrobot parameters were set as follows: blot time 2, wait time 0, drain time 0, blot force 1, humidity 100%, temperature 12 &deg;C.\n\"Double-blotted\" grids had a protein droplet loaded, manually blotted with torn Whatman filter paper, and a fresh droplet loaded onto the grid before Vitrobot blotting (with Vitrobot filter paper rings) and freezing.\nThis double-blotting process typically took approximately five seconds from first drop to plunge-freeze.\nIn all cases, each protein droplet was 3 &mu;L.\n\n![Fab binding induces only minor changes in the extracellular domain of ENaC.

Human CKO nanodisc model is colored by subunit, the human CKO/DEG ENaC is white, and human CKO/DEG Fabs are grey.](figures/matmeth/fabs/fabs.png){#fig-fab-compare}\n\nMost datasets were collected with at least one of our two pseudosymmetry-breaking Fabs, developed previously[@noreng18].\nI have switched from using both Fabs to only using one, because the &beta;-binding Fab is more flexible than the &alpha;-binding Fab, and this flexibility reduces overall alignment property.\nAdditionally, one of the two human CKO datasets was first incorporated into nanodiscs and solved without any Fabs.\nAs expected based on our previous studies of electrophysiology of the Fab-bound channels, our ECD models with and without Fab are largely indistinguishable (@fig-fab-compare B,C)[@noreng20].\nNeither fab significantly distorts the surrounding ECD environment when bound.\nThe &alpha;-binding Fab induces a slight shift in a region near the &beta;-ball, while the &beta;-binding Fab induces no detectable change at all.\n\n## cryoEM Data Collection\nDatasets were collected using SerialEM by microscopy core staff at the facilities used (@tbl-model-building)[@mastronarde2003].\nIn all cases, multi-shot multi-hole regimes were used to maximize the number of movies recorded.\nNumber of shots per hole and maximum beam shift were a function of ice quality and grid type, but typically a 3x3 pattern of holes was imaged 2--4 times per hole.\n\n## cryoEM Image Processing\n\nEach dataset was processed slightly differently, but following the same general pipeline.\nFirst, movies were imported into cryoSPARC for pre-processing.\nDefault parameters were used for both motion correction and CTF estimation.\nNext, particles were picked using the blob picker in cryoSPARC.\nAdjustments were made to the minimum and maximum radii to account for the number of Fabs present in each sample.\nBlob picks for several micrographs were manually inspected and adjusted.\nFirst, the NCC parameter was adjusted until few contaminant and carbon-edge picks remained.\nNext, in a low-defocus micrograph, the low power threshold was adjusted to remove empty ice picks.\nFinally, in a high-defocus micrograph, the high power threshold was adjusted to remove all carbon-edge and contaminant picks.\nThese initial blob picks were cleaned by 2D classification, and the resulting particle sets used to generate templates for template picking.\nTemplate picked thresholds were adjusted as for blob picked particles.\n\nThe template picked particles were repeatedly 3D classified using heterogeneous refinement in cryoSPARC, providing one \"good\" class and a number of \"junk\" classes (typically noisy or bad *ab initio* models of the blob picked particles) until all particles produced reasonable ENaC classes.\nThe final particle set was never 2D classified, since I find that 2D classification reduces the frequency of rare particle views.\nFrom this point, processing proceeded *ad hoc* to produce the final maps (Image Processing).\n\n![S^2^C^2^ pixel sizes seem miscalibrated. **A**: Scaling the nominal pixel size for human CKO/DEG dramatically increases the correlation with human CKO digitonin. **B**: Correlation coefficients for all maps.

(Uniprot ID Q61180), &beta; (Uniprot ID Q9WU38), and &gamma; (Uniprot ID Q9WU39) were joined using 10xGS linkers between &alpha; and &beta;, and &beta; and &gamma;.\nThis meta-sequence was then entered as the AlphaFold target.\nThe linkers and large, unstructured, low-confidence loops were removed from the model before proceeding.\n\nBefore docking into experimental maps, starting models had Fabs and waters deleted to ease early model building steps.\nInitial models were rigid-body fitted into the experimental maps.\nAny loops in poor or missing regions of the map were deleted.\nThe whole models were simulated with distance restraints using ISOLDE and ChimeraX[@croll2018; @pettersen2021].\nOnce models were roughly fit into the potential, strained distance restraints were released.\nOnce the backbone appeared to fit reasonably well into the map, all distance restraints were released.\nSimulating one chain at a time, a pass over every residue in ENaC was performed, focusing on Ramachandran values and rotamers.\nOnce all chains had been optimized in this manner, glycans were added using Coot's carbohydrate module[@emsley2010].\nFabs were rigid-body fitted and simulated similarly to the initial models once these steps were complete.\n\nModels were refined using Phenix real-space refinement[@liebschner2019].\nIn some cases, the TMD map was used as-is for refinement.\nIn other cases, the ECD and TMD map were combined using Phenix's \"Combine Focused Maps\" job and the resulting map was used for refinement.\nIn these cases, the lowest GSFSC resolution was provided to Phenix.\nParameters were left as default, except rotamers were only refined when they had both poor map quality *and* were outliers (rather than *or*).\nI changed this setting because rotamer and clash statistics were significantly worse if it was left as the default.\nModel quality was assessed using MolProbity within Phenix, Q-scores calculated in ChimeraX, and 3DFSC as implemented in cryoSPARC (@tbl-model-building and @sec-validation)[@williams2018; @pintilie2020; @aiyer2021].\n\n## Constructs\n<!-- TODO: fix LaTeX table output -->\n\n\n::: {#tbl-model-building .cell tbl-cap='Image processing and model building statistics.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\setlength{\\LTpost}{0mm}\n\\begin{longtable}{l|cccccc}\n\\toprule\n\\multicolumn{1}{l}{} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{human CKO} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{human CKO/DEG} & \\multicolumn{2}{c}{mouse} \\\\ \n\\cmidrule(lr){2-3} \\cmidrule(lr){4-5} \\cmidrule(lr){6-7}\n\\multicolumn{1}{l}{} & Digitonin & Nanodisc & Difab & Monofab & Uncleaved & Trypsin \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{Construct Summary} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nα mutations & C63A, R178A, R204A & C63A, R178A, R204A & C63A, R178A, R204A, T240W & C63A, R178A, R204A, T240W & — & — \\\\ \nβ mutations & C30A & C30A & C30A, S520K & C30A, S520K & — & — \\\\ \nγ mutations & C33A, C41A, R138A & C33A, C41A, R138A & C33A, C41A, R138A & C33A, C41A, R138A & — & — \\\\ \nOther treatments & — & POPC nanodisc & — & 1 mM C8 PIP₂ & — & 10 μg/mL trypsin for 5 minutes \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{Grid Preparation} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nENaC (μM) & 19.8 & 2 & 21.3 & 24 & 9.6 & 9.6 \\\\ \nSalt & NaCl & KCl & KCl & KCl & KCl & KCl \\\\ \nAcid Shock & Yes & No & Yes & No & No & No \\\\ \nFabs & α and β & — & α and β & α & α & α \\\\ \nGrid Type\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}} & 2/1 200 & 2/2 200 + 2 nm carbon & 2/1 200 & 2/1 200 & 2/2 200 & 2/1 200 \\\\ \nFOM (μM) & 2 & 10 & 10 & 2 & 100 & 2 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{Microscopy} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nFacility & PNCC & S2C2 & S2C2 & PNCC & Janelia Farm & Janelia Farm \\\\ \nNo. Movies & 13,689 & 9,882 & 5,126 & 5,832 & 11,334 & 6,960 \\\\ \nFrames\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}} & 50 & 65 & 50 & 50 & 65 & 65 \\\\ \nPixel Size (Å/pix)\\textsuperscript{\\textit{3,4,5}} & 0.8015 & 0.86 & 0.86 & 0.830 & 0.844 & 0.788 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{Processing} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nNo. particles & 612,591 & 237,730 & 257,341 & 373,495 & 499,081 & 264,228 \\\\ \nECD resolution (Å)\\textsuperscript{\\textit{6,7}} & 2.34 & 3.06 & 2.94 & — & — & 3.03 \\\\ \nWhole protein resolution (Å)\\textsuperscript{\\textit{6,7}} & 2.89 & — & 3.26 & 3.04 & 3.24 & 3.30 \\\\ \nECD sharpening factor\\textsuperscript{\\textit{6}} & -56.6 & -77.1 & -88.9 & — & — & -66.7 \\\\ \nWhole protein sharpening factor\\textsuperscript{\\textit{6}} & -66.0 & — & -110.4 & -104.4 & -96.4 & -67.4 \\\\ \n\\midrule\n\\multicolumn{7}{l}{Model Building} \\\\ \n\\midrule\nStarting model & 6WTH & CKO digitonin & 6WTH & CKO/DEG difab & AlphaFold & mouse uncleaved \\\\ \nNo. non-H atoms & 12,416 & 9,971 & 12,807 & 11,588 & 11,466 & 11,617 \\\\ \nNo. residues & 1,628 & 1,174 & 1,714 & 1,476 & 1,506 & 1,540 \\\\ \nNo. ligands\\textsuperscript{\\textit{8}} & 49 & 38 & 35 & 43 & 26 & 29 \\\\ \nBond length RMSD & 0.006 & 0.003 & 0.003 & 0.004 & 0.003 & 0.003 \\\\ \nBond angle RMSD & 0.709 & 0.505 & 0.519 & 0.499 & 0.438 & 0.446 \\\\ \nMolprobity score & 1.49 & 1.11 & 1.10 & 1.27 & 1.48 & 1.44 \\\\ \nClash score & 4.61 & 3.14 & 3.06 & 5.03 & 6.44 & 5.70 \\\\ \nRama. outliers (\\%) & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\\\ \nRama. allowed (\\%) & 2.00 & 1.57 & 1.26 & 1.82 & 2.65 & 2.67 \\\\ \nRama. favored (\\%) & 98.00 & 98.43 & 98.74 & 98.18 & 97.35 & 97.33 \\\\ \nRotamer outliers & 2.15 & 0.09 & 0.72 & 0.28 & 0.09 & 0.00 \\\\ \nCβ outliers & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\\\ \nCaBLAM outliers & 0.81 & 0.44 & 0.40 & 1.15 & 1.52 & 0.86 \\\\ \nResolution (0.143 FSC) & 2.3 & 2.9 & 2.8 & 3.1 & 3.2 & 3.0 \\\\ \nCC (mask) & 0.85 & 0.84 & 0.83 & 0.82 & 0.83 & 0.84 \\\\ \nQ-score\\textsuperscript{\\textit{9}} & 0.80 & 0.71 & 0.71 & 0.71 & 0.68 & 0.72 \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n\\begin{minipage}{\\linewidth}\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{1}}All grids are Quantifoil grids with gold mesh\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{2}}Electron flux is 1 e⁻/Å²/frame\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{3}}All datsets collected in super-resolution mode and Fourier-cropped back to this physical size.\\\\\n\\textsuperscript{\\textit{4}}Resolutions here are nominal resolutions given by the microscopy facility.
