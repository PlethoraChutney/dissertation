TMDs of all six ENaC models separated by TM conformation, viewed from the intracellular side. Models are in the same position and at the same scale in each image, so positions are directly comparable. A grated circle is added in the same position to aid comparison between panels.](figures/TM-overview/tm-overview.png){#fig-tm-overview}\n\nIn all six of our models, the visible TMs are arranged in a roughly triangular fashion around a central helix (@fig-tm-overview A).\nIn CKO/DEG channels this helix is &gamma; TM2.\nIn all other models, the central helix is &beta; TM2.\nI thus name the two conformations &gamma;-in or &beta;-in, respectively.\nI observe no change in the TMD open addition of PIP~2~.\nUnfortunately, &alpha;TM2 and &gamma;TM1 are only visible in the &beta;-in conformation.\nThe arrangement of and great distance between pore-forming TM2 helices observed in our maps (@fig-tm-slices) also runs counter to existing knowledge of ENaC's pore [@schild1997].\nGiven this surprising state and the low quality of the maps' TMDs, I limit technical discussion of the TMD and hope that future studies will better resolve this critical channel domain.\nI do also note that although our cryoEM maps support the presence of the &alpha;T240W mutation, I observe no significant rearrangement of the nearby residues (@fig-t240w).\n\n![Slices through the ENaC TMD reveal a non-physiological arrangement. Slices of the models with the best TMD density for both of &beta;-in and &gamma;-in (mouse trypsin and CKO/DEG difab, respectively) are displayed at four Z coordinates. The C&alpha; of the residue closest to each Z coordinate is plotted in the horizontal XY plane and assigned a symbol to aid viewing. TM1 residues are circles; TM2 residues are squares. &beta;-in residues have black borders, while &gamma;-in residues have grey borders. Arrows connect the &beta;-in residue to its cognate &gamma;-in residue. If all three TM2 helices are modeled, they are connected by a triangle to represent the size of the pore at that Z slice.](figures/tm-slices/tm-slices.png){#fig-tm-slices}\n\n![The &alpha;T240W mutation does not modify ECD conformation. **A**: Stereo view of the GRIP domain near &alpha;T240.

Note that although the background counts have been subtracted, the relationship between ligand and counts is still linear.](results_transmembrane-domain_files/figure-docx/fig-spa-example-1.png){#fig-spa-example}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\nIn a SPA assay, the protein of interest is bound to beads which contain a scintillant.\nRadiolabeled ligand is then added to the mixture.\nIf the ligand binds the protein, it is close enough to the beads that the &beta;-particles can interact with the scintillant, emitting light.\nThese counts can be taken as a measurement of binding affinity.\nSome argue that measuring affinity for a pore-binding ligand is a proxy for measuring proper folding of the pore [@quick2007].\n\nI won't cover in detail all the forms of SPA I attempted; none of the various optimizations or tweaks made any real difference in detectable ligand binding (@fig-spa-example).\nOur main issue was non-specific binding.\nWe could never measure the non-specific binding in its entirety, and so any signal that may potentially have been present was swamped out in noise.\nChanging from detergent sample to nanodiscs did not improve signal.\nNeither did changing from standard SPA beads to smaller, higher SNR nanoSPA beads.\n\n## What can be salvaged?\n\nI've tried a great list of experiments to improve the quality of our TMD, none of which really worked.\nI've also tried a number of functional assays of purified protein, again, none of which worked.\nUnfortunately, we don't have a good positive control for these functional assays &mdash; it's entirely possible that they *do* work, but that the protein itself is all bad.\nIn any case, here's what of my work can be carried forward into future studies.\n\n### Future studies should avoid digitonin\n\nI believe the TMD is misfolded as a result of solubilization with digitonin.\nDigitonin solubilizes membranes by chelating cholesterol [@sudji2015].\nENaC preferentially exists in lipid rafts [@hill07].\nENaC is activated by cholesterol-mediated PIP~2~ interactions [@zhai19].\nAdditionally, the helices in the low-resolution TMD region of truncated ENaC solved in DDM do have the expected TM2-inward layout [@noreng18].\nOf course, all of the TMD maps to date are very low-resolution.\nAlthough I am confident in my TM assignments, it is possible that the wrong TM identity has been assigned to some of the densities.\nHopefully future, higher-resolution maps of the TMD will settle the matter.\n\n### Cysteine knock-out mutations should be abandoned\n\nThe CKO mutations do increase ENaC yield, but their theoretical underpinning is not sound at all.[Recall that CKO channels have the following mutations in addition to protease site knockouts: &alpha;C63A, &beta;C30A, and &gamma;C33,41A]{.aside}\nChannels with either one of &gamma;C33A and/or &gamma;C41A exhibit reduced current compared with wild type despite no change in surface expression [@mukherjee14].\nReduction in the double mutant currents is a result both of decreased P~O~ and increased sodium self inhibition.\n&gamma;C33 and C41 border the HG motif &mdash; any disruption here might have serious consequences on the physiological relevance of a resolved TMD structure.\nBeyond the concerning question of whether the mutant channels would then recapitulate physiological ENaC gating processes, they clearly act in opposition to the goal of creating channels biased to the open state in CKO/DEG.\n\nConversely, if the goal is to disrupt palmitoylated sites (which, nominally, it was not), why are &alpha;C63 and &beta;C30 knocked out when they are known not to be palmitoylated in the cell [@mueller10]?\nOr, if the goal is to knock out *all* potential palmitoylation sites, why are the majority left un-mutated?\nFundamentally, the CKO mutations are logically inconsistent and should either be abandoned or consolidated behind a single theory of action.\n\n### Acid shock\n\nI briefly tried \"acid shocking\" ENaC during the purification.\nMy thinking was that poorly folded ENaC would be the first to aggregate under stressful conditions, leaving behind higher quality material.\nSimilar treatments could have been high temperature or salt concentrations &mdash; there was nothing theoretically special about pH aside from the fact that ENaC and channels like it are sensitive to pH.\nI did not notice a difference in total yield (beyond the losses expected from salt exchange alone), leading me to believe that the procedure did not have any real effect on ENaC, regardless of its folding state.\nAdditionally, maps made with acid-shocked material (CKO digitonin and CKO/DEG difab) are not of substantially higher quality than the other, un-shocked maps.\n\n<!-- Move this to the end of content so the margins are right in citations -->\n:::{.content-hidden unless-format=\"pdf\"}\n\\newgeometry{left=1in, right=1in}\n:::",
