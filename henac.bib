  abstract = {1 Regulation of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is essential for the control of body sodium homeostasis. The downregulation of the activity of this Na+ channel that occurs when the intracellular Na+ concentration ([Na+]i) is increased is known as feedback inhibition. Although intracellular Na+ is the trigger for this phenomenon, its cellular and molecular mediators are unknown. 2 We used the ?cut-open oocyte? technique to control the composition of the intracellular milieu of Xenopus oocytes expressing rat ENaCs to enable us to test several factors potentially involved in feedback inhibition. 3 The effects of perfusion of the intracellular space were demonstrated by an electromicrographic study and the time course of the intracellular solution exchange was established by observing the effect of intracellular pH: a decrease from pH 7.4 to 6.5 reduced the amiloride-sensitive current by about 40 \% within 2 min. 4 Feedback inhibition was observed in non-perfused oocytes when Na+ entry induced a large increase in [Na+]i. Intracellular perfusion prevented feedback regulation even though the [Na+]i was allowed to increase to values above 50 mM. 5 No effects on the amiloride-sensitive current were observed after changes in the concentration of Na+ (from 1 to 50 mM), Ca2+ (from 10 to 1000 nM) or ATP (from nominally free to 1 or 5 mM) in the intracellular perfusate. 6 We conclude that feedback inhibition requires intracellular factors that can be removed by intracellular perfusion. Although a rise in [Na+]i may be the trigger for the feedback inhibition of the ENaC, this effect is not mediated by a direct effect of Na+, Ca2+ or ATP on the ENaC protein.}

  abstract = {Abstract. Prostasin, a novel serine protease, was purified from seminal fluid, and its cDNA sequence was determined. Expression of prostasin was detected in human tissues, including prostate, kidney, and lung, as well as bodily fluids, including seminal fluid and urine. However, its physiologic role in the human body is not known. Recently, a novel regulatory mechanism by which serine proteases activate epithelial sodium channel in the Xenopus oocyte was identified. Therefore, it was hypothesized that prostasin could activate sodium currents, and a rat prostasin cDNA clone was isolated to investigate its physiologic function. Rat prostasin mRNA is expressed predominantly in kidney, and lower levels of expression were detected in prostate, lung, colon, stomach, and skin. These all are epithelial tissues in which the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is expressed. Coexpression of rat prostasin and rat ENaC in Xenopus oocytes increased the amiloride-sensitive sodium current by twofold. Preincubation of oocytes that expressed prostasin with aprotinin did not result in an increase in sodium current, compared with the control. The removal of aprotinin from the bath solution resulted in a twofold increase of the current only in oocytes that expressed prostasin, which indicates that protease activity of prostasin is required for the ENaC activation. Expression of rat prostasin had no effect on the potassium current when expressed with rat renal outer medulla K channel, which shows specificity of prostasin action for ENaC. These results indicate that prostasin acts as an extracellular regulator of ENaC.}

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Epithelial cells are exposed to a variety of mechanical forces, but little is known about the impact of these forces on epithelial ion channels. Here we show that mechanical activation of epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs), which are essential for electrolyte and water balance, occurs via an increased ion channel open probability. ENaC activity of heterologously expressed rat (rENaC) and Xenopus (xENaC) orthologs was measured by whole-cell as well as single-channel recordings. Laminar shear stress (LSS), producing shear forces in physiologically relevant ranges, was used to mechanically stimulate ENaCs and was able to activate ENaC currents in whole-cell recordings. Preceding pharmacological activation of rENaC with Zn2+ and xENaC with gadolinium and glibenclamide largely prevented LSS-activated currents. In contrast, proteo-lytic cleavage with trypsin potentiated the LSS effect on rENaC whereas the LSS effect on xENaC was reversed (inhibition of xENaC current). Further, we found that exposure of excised outside-out patches to LSS led to an increased ion channel open probability without affecting the number of active channels. We suggest that mechano-sensitivity of ENaC may represent a ubiquitous feature for the physiology of epithelia, providing a putative mechanism for coupling transepi-thelial Na+ reabsorption to luminal transport.?Althaus, M., Bogdan, R., Clauss, W.

  abstract = {Mouse channel activating proteases 1, 2, and 3 (mCAP1, mCAP2, and mCAP3) were described recently as regulators of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). The mCAP are membrane-bound serine proteases that are synthesized as inactive proenzymes. To mature into active proteases, they undergo intramolecular cleavage by auto- and/or heterocatalytic processing. Specific antibodies against each mCAP were developed to distinguish between proenzyme and active protease by Western blot analysis. Various point mutations were introduced in the catalytic or protein–protein interacting domains of mCAP and wild-type and mutant enzymes were expressed in the Xenopus oocyte expression system to test for ability to activate ENaC. In mCAP3, an intact catalytic triad was necessary for activation of ENaC but not for intramolecular cleavage of the protease. This suggests a heterocatalytic mechanism. Mutating the catalytic triad of mCAP2 not only abolished ENaC activation completely but also impeded cleavage of the protease. Processing of mCAP2 therefore seems to be autocatalytic. Furthermore, mutations in conserved residues of mCAP2 located in two protein–protein interacting domains significantly modulated ENaC activation. Surprisingly, mCAP1 catalytically inactive mutants were still able to fully activate ENaC, and no evidence of mCAP1 intramolecular cleavage was seen. The presence of an intact glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, however, was required. It is concluded that auto- and heterocatalytic requirements are specific for each CAP and that endogenous partners are a necessity for activation of ENaC by mCAP in the Xenopus oocyte expression system.},

  abstract = {TLRs (Toll-like receptors) provide a mechanism for host defence immune responses. Activated TLRs lead to the recruitment of adaptor proteins to their cytosolic tails, which in turn promote the activation of IRAKs (interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinases). IRAKs act upon their transcription factor targets to influence the expression of genes involved in the immune response. Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) modulates IRAK function in the TLR signalling pathway. Tollip is multimodular, with a conserved C2 domain of unknown function. We found that the Tollip C2 domain preferentially interacts with phosphoinositides, most notably with PtdIns3P (phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate) and PtdIns(4,5)P2 (phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate), in a Ca2+-independent manner. However, NMR analysis demonstrates that the Tollip C2 domain binds Ca2+, which may be required to target the membrane interface. NMR and lipid–protein overlay analyses suggest that PtdIns3P and PtdIns(4,5)P2 share interacting residues in the protein. Kinetic studies reveal that the C2 domain reversibly binds PtdIns3P and PtdIns(4,5)P2, with affinity values in the low micromolar range. Mutational analysis identifies key PtdIns3P- and PtdIns(4,5)P2-binding conserved basic residues in the protein. Our findings suggest that basic residues of the C2 domain mediate membrane targeting of Tollip by interaction with phosphoinositides, which contribute to the observed partition of the protein in different subcellular compartments.

  abstract = {Eukaryotic elongation factor-2 kinase (eEF-2 kinase) is a highly conserved calcium/calmodulin-dependent enzyme involved in the regulation of protein translation and cell proliferation. Rapid changes in the activity and abundance of eEF-2 kinase have been observed on growth stimulation, and increased enzyme activity is characteristic of malignant cell growth. Yet the mechanism for controlling the turnover of this kinase is unknown. The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the degradation of many cellular proteins, including transcription factors, cell cycle regulators, and signal transduction proteins. Therefore, we determined whether the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway regulates the turnover of eEF-2 kinase. We found that eEF-2 kinase was a relatively short-lived protein with a half-life of less than 6 hours. eEF-2 kinase was ubiquitinated in vivo as determined by coimmunoprecipitation and polyubiquitin affinity matrix. Incubation of purified eEF-2 kinase with a source of ubiquitination enzymes (rabbit reticulocyte lysate), purified ubiquitin, and ATP revealed the presence of increasing molecular weight species of ubiquitinated eEF-2 kinase. Treatment of cells with MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, inhibited eEF-2 kinase degradation and induced the accumulation of polyubiquitinated forms of the enzyme, resulting in an increase in its half-life. These results suggest involvement of the proteasome in the turnover of the ubiquitinated kinase. Because eEF-2 kinase is chaperoned by heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), we next determined if disruption of the Hsp90-eEF-2 kinase complex promoted degradation of the kinase. Treatment of cells with geldanamycin, an Hsp90 inhibitor, enhanced ubiquitination of eEF-2 kinase and decreased the half-life of the kinase to less than 2 hours. These results indicate that cellular levels of eEF-2 kinase are maintained by a balance between association with Hsp90 and degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In conclusion, these data show that the turnover of eEF-2 kinase is regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and, therefore, modulating the ubiquitination of eEF-2 kinase might control the abundance of this enzyme and have implications in the treatment of certain forms of cancer. ©2005 American Association for Cancer Research.}

  abstract = {The highly selective, amilorideblockable Na+ channel is a major target to the natriferic action of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone. This rat epithelial Na+ channel (rENaC) has been recently cloned from colon and is composed of three homologous subunits denoted alpha-, beta-, and gamma-rENaC (C. M. Canessa, L. Schild, G. Buell, B. Thorens, L. Gautschi, J.-D. Horisberger, and B. C. Rossier. Nature Lond. 367: 463-467, 1994). We have tested the effects of corticosteroids on the abundance of mRNA coding for each subunit in kidney cortex and distal colon. Chronic treatment of rats with aldosterone or dexamethasone evoked in kidney cortex a small induction of alpha-rENaC and no change in beta- and gamma-rENaC. In distal colon, however, beta- and gamma-rENaC were strongly induced by either aldosterone or dexamethasone, whereas alpha-rENaC was constitutively expressed. Most of the aldosterone-induced increase in beta- and gamma-rENaC mRNA took place during 3-24 h after plasma aldosterone was elevated. A similar differential induction of rENaC subunits in kidney and colon was also evoked by a Na(+)-free diet. The effects of salt deprivation were reversed by resalinating rats with a half time of {$<$} 2 h, suggesting a high turnover rate of at least beta- and gamma-rENaC. The data are consistent with the possibility that induction of channel subunits contributes to the chronic but not the acute response to aldosterone in the colon. Such a mechanism is not likely to play a major role in cortical collecting ducts.}

Experiments were performed in Xenopus oocytes and in planar lipid bilayers. At a holding potential of -100 mV, amiloride-sensitive current averaged -1,279 +/- 111 nA (n = 7) in alpha beta gamma-rENaC-expressing oocytes. Currents in water-injected oocytes were essentially unresponsive to 10 microM amiloride. A 1-h stimulation of PKC with 100 nM of PMA inhibited whole-cell currents in Xenopus oocytes to 17.1 +/- 1.8, and 22.1 +/- 2.6\% of control (n = 7), at holding potentials of -100 and +40 mV, respectively. Direct injection of purified PKC resulted in similar inhibition to that observed with PMA. Additionally, the inactive phorbol ester, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate, 4-O-methyl, was without effect on alpha beta gamma-rENaC currents. Pretreatment with the microtubule inhibitor colchicine (100 microM) did not modify the inhibitory effect of PMA; however, pretreatment with 20 microM cytochalasin B decreased the inhibitory action of PMA to \&lt; 20\% of that previously observed. In vitro-synthesized alpha beta gamma-rENaC formed an amiloride-sensitive Na(+)-selective channel when incorporated into planar lipid bilayers. Addition of PKC, diacyl-glycerol, and Mg-ATP to the side opposite that which amiloride blocked, decreased the channel's open probability (Po) from 0.44 +/- 0.06 to 0.13 +/- 0.03 (n = 9). To study the effects of PKA on alpha beta gamma-rENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes, cAMP levels were elevated with 10 microM forskolin and 1 mM isobutyl-methyl-xanthine. This cAMP-elevating cocktail did not cause any stimulation of alpha beta gamma-rENaC currents in either the inward or outward directions. This lack of activation was also observed in oocytes preinhibited with PMA and in oocytes pretreated with cytochalasin B and PMA. Neither alpha-rENaC nor alpha beta gamma-rENaC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers could be activated with PKA and Mg-ATP added to either side of the membrane, as Po remained at 0.63 +/- 0.06 (n = 7) and 0.45 +/- 0.05 (n = 9), respectively. We conclude that: alpha beta gamma-rENaC is inhibited by PKC, and that alpha beta gamma-rENaC is not activated by PKA.},

  abstract = {Abstract We investigated whether mutations in the genes that code for the different subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) might result in cystic fibrosis (CF)-like disease. In a small fraction of the patients, the disease could be potentially explained by an ENaC mutation by a Mendelian mechanism, such as p.V114I and p.F61L in SCNN1A. More importantly, a more than three-fold significant increase in incidence of several rare ENaC polymorphisms was found in the patient group (30\% vs. 9\% in controls), indicating an involvement of ENaC in some patients by a polygenetic mechanism. Specifically, a significantly higher number of patients carried c.?55+5G{$>$}C or p.W493R in SCNN1A in the heterozygous state, with odds ratios (ORs) of 13.5 and 2.7, respectively.The p.W493R-SCNN1A polymorphism was even found to result in a four-fold more active ENaC channel when heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. About 1 in 975 individuals in the general population will be heterozygous for the hyperactive p.W493R-SCNN1A mutation and a cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene that results in very low amounts (0?10\%) functional CFTR.

  abstract = {Acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) are voltage-independent, amiloride-sensitive channels involved in diverse physiological processes ranging from nociception to taste. Despite the importance of ASICs in physiology, we know little about the mechanism of channel activation. Here we show that psalmotoxin activates non-selective and Na+-selective currents in chicken ASIC1a at pH\,7.25 and 5.5, respectively. Crystal structures of ASIC1a–psalmotoxin complexes map the toxin binding site to the extracellular domain and show how toxin binding triggers an expansion of the extracellular vestibule and stabilization of the open channel pore. At pH\,7.25 the pore is approximately 10\,Å in diameter, whereas at pH\,5.5 the pore is largely hydrophobic and elliptical in cross-section with dimensions of approximately 5 by 7\,Å, consistent with a barrier mechanism for ion selectivity. These studies define mechanisms for activation of ASICs, illuminate the basis for dynamic ion selectivity and provide the blueprints for new therapeutic agents.}

Here, we determine the cocrystal structure of chicken ASIC1a with MitTx, a pain-inducing toxin from the Texas coral snake, to define the structure of the open state of ASIC1a. In the MitTx-bound open state and in the previously determined low-pH desensitized state, TM2 is a discontinuous α helix in which the Gly-Ala-Ser selectivity filter adopts an extended, belt-like conformation, swapping the cytoplasmic one-third of TM2 with an adjacent subunit. Gly 443 residues of the selectivity filter provide a ring of three carbonyl oxygen atoms with a radius of ∼3.6~Å, presenting an energetic barrier for hydrated ions. The ASIC1a-MitTx complex illuminates the mechanism of MitTx action, defines the structure of the selectivity filter of voltage-independent, sodium-selective ion channels, and captures the open state of an ASIC.}

We continuously monitored short-circuit current (Isc), transepithelial conductance (GT), and transepithelial capacitance (CT) to evaluate the effects of cholesterol extraction from the apical and basolateral membranes in steady-state conditions and during activation with hyposmotic shock, oxytocin, and adenosine. Cholesterol extraction was achieved by perfusing the epithelia with methyl-?-cyclodextrin (m?CD) for 1 h. In steady-state conditions, apical membrane cholesterol extraction did not significantly affect the electrophysiological parameters; in contrast, marked reductions were observed during basolateral m?CD treatment. However, apical m?CD application hampered the responses of Isc and GT to hypotonicity, oxytocin, and adenosine. Analysis of the blocker-induced fluctuation in Isc demonstrated that apical m?CD treatment decreased the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) open probability (Po) in the steady state as well as after activation of Na+ transport by adenosine, whereas the density of conducting channels was not significantly changed as confirmed by CT measurements. Na+ transport activation by hypotonicity was abolished during basolateral m?CD treatment as a result of reduced Na+/K+ pump activity. On the basis of the findings in this study, we conclude that basolateral membrane cholesterol extraction reduces Na+/K+ pump activity, whereas the reduced cholesterol content of the apical membranes affects the activation of Na+ transport by reducing ENaC Po.}

These enzymes largely determine the specificity of the ubiquitination reaction.

Indeed, excessive degradation of relevant tumor-suppressor molecules and impaired disposal of oncogenic proteins have been linked to tumorigenesis.

  abstract = {Serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 (SGK1) is an aldosterone-regulated early response gene product that regulates the activity of several ion transport proteins, most notably that of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Recent evidence has established that SGK1 phosphorylates and inhibits Nedd4-2 (neural precursor cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2), a ubiquitin ligase that decreases cell surface expression of the channel and possibly stimulates its degradation. The mechanistic basis for this SGK1-induced Nedd4-2 inhibition is currently unknown. In this study we show that SGK1-mediated phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 induces its interaction with members of the 14-3-3 family of regulatory proteins. Through functional characterization of Nedd4-2-mutant proteins, we demonstrate that this interaction is required for SGK1-mediated inhibition of Nedd4-2. The concerted action of SGK1 and 14-3-3 appears to disrupt Nedd4-2-mediated ubiquitination of ENaC, thus providing a mechanism by which SGK1 modulates the ENaC-mediated Na+ current. Finally, the expression pattern of 14-3-3 is also consistent with a functional role in distal nephron Na+ transport. These results demonstrate a novel, physiologically significant role for 14-3-3 proteins in modulating ubiquitin ligase-dependent pathways in the control of epithelial ion transport.}

To further examine the role of Nedd4-2 in the regulation of ENaC by AMPK, we studied the effects of AMPK activation on ENaC currents in Xenopus oocytes co-expressing ENaC and wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of Nedd4-2. ENaC inhibition by AMPK was preserved in oocytes expressing WT Nedd4-2 but blocked in oocytes expressing either a dominant-negative (DN) or constitutively active (CA) Nedd4-2 mutant, suggesting that AMPK-dependent modulation of Nedd4-2 function is involved. Similar experiments utilizing WT or mutant forms of the serum- and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1), modulators of protein kinase A (PKA), or extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) did not affect ENaC inhibition by AMPK, suggesting that these pathways known to modulate the Nedd4-2-ENaC interaction are not responsible. AMPK-dependent phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 expressed in HEK-293 cells occurred both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a potential mechanism for modulation of Nedd4-2 and thus cellular ENaC activity. Moreover, cellular AMPK activation significantly enhanced the interaction of the β-ENaC subunit with Nedd4-2, as measured by co-immunoprecipitation assays in HEK-293 cells. In summary, these results suggest a novel mechanism for ENaC regulation in which AMPK promotes ENaC-Nedd4-2 interaction, thereby inhibiting ENaC by increasing Nedd4-2-dependent ENaC retrieval from the plasma membrane. AMPK-dependent ENaC inhibition may limit cellular Na+ loading under conditions of metabolic stress when AMPK becomes activated.}

Understanding the regulation of this channel is critical to the understanding of various clinical phenomena, including normal physiology and several diseases of kidney and lung epithelia, such as blood pressure (BP) control, edema, and airway fluid clearance. Significant progress has been achieved in this active field of research. Although ENaC is classically thought to be a mediator of BP and volume status through Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron, several studies in animal models highlight important roles for ENaC in lung pathophysiology, including in cystic fibrosis. The purpose of this review is to highlight the various modes and mechanisms of ENaC regulation, with a focus on more recent studies and their clinical implications.}

Its activity controls the rate of transepithelial sodium transport. Among other regulatory factors, ENaC activity is controlled by the concentration of extracellular Na+, a phenomenon named self-inhibition. The molecular mechanism by which extracellular Na+ concentration is detected is not known. To investigate the properties of the extracellular Na+ sensing site, we studied the effects of extracellular cations on steady-state amiloride-sensitive outward currents in Na+-loaded oocytes expressing human ENaC and compared them with self-inhibition of inward current after fast solution changes. About half of the inhibition of outward Na+ currents was due to self-inhibition itself and the rest might be attributed to conduction site saturation. Self-inhibition by extracellular Li+ was similar to that of Na+ except for slightly slower kinetics. Ionic selectivity of the inhibition for steady-state outward current was Na+ ≥ Li+ {$>$} K+. We estimated an apparent inhibitory constant (KI) of ?40 mM for extracellular Na+ and Li+ and found no evidence for a voltage dependence of the KI. Protease treatment induced the expected increase of the amiloride-sensitive current measured in high-Na+ concentrations which was due, at least in part, to abolition of self-inhibition. These results demonstrate that both self-inhibition and saturation play a significant role in the inhibition of ENaC by extracellular Na+ and that Na+ and Li+ interact in a similar way with the extracellular cation sensing site.}

  abstract = {Ubiquitin ligases play a pivotal role in substrate recognition and ubiquitin transfer, yet little is known about the regulation of their catalytic activity. Nedd4 (neural-precursor-cell-expressed, developmentally down-regulated 4)-2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase composed of a C2 domain, four WW domains (protein–protein interaction domains containing two conserved tryptophan residues) that bind PY motifs (L/PPXY) and a ubiquitin ligase HECT (homologous with E6-associated protein C-terminus) domain. In the present paper we show that the WW domains of Nedd4-2 bind (weakly) to a PY motif (LPXY) located within its own HECT domain and inhibit auto-ubiquitination. Pulse–chase experiments demonstrated that mutation of the HECT PY-motif decreases the stability of Nedd4-2, suggesting that it is involved in stabilization of this E3 ligase. Interestingly, the HECT PY-motif mutation does not affect ubiquitination or down-regulation of a known Nedd4-2 substrate, ENaC (epithelial sodium channel). ENaC ubiquitination, in turn, appears to promote Nedd4-2 self-ubiquitination. These results support a model in which the inter- or intra-molecular WW-domain–HECT PY-motif interaction stabilizes Nedd4-2 by preventing self-ubiquitination. Substrate binding disrupts this interaction, allowing self-ubiquitination of Nedd4-2 and subsequent degradation, resulting in down-regulation of Nedd4-2 once it has ubiquitinated its target. These findings also point to a novel mechanism employed by a ubiquitin ligase to regulate itself differentially compared with substrate ubiquitination and stability.

Maturation and activation of ENaC subunits involves furin-dependent cleavage of the ectodomain at two sites in the α subunit and at a single site within the γ subunit. We now report that the serine protease prostasin further activates ENaC by inducing cleavage of the γ subunit at a site distal to the furin cleavage site. Dual cleavage of the γ subunit is predicted to release a 43-amino acid peptide. Channels with a γ subunit lacking this 43-residue tract have increased activity due to a high open probability. A synthetic peptide corresponding to the fragment cleaved from the γ subunit is a reversible inhibitor of endogenous ENaCs in mouse cortical-collecting duct cells and in primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells. Our results suggest that multiple proteases cleave ENaC γ subunits to fully activate the channel.}

The genes encoding the three ENaC subunits are likewise important contributors to hypertension, both in rare monogenic diseases and in the general population. The unusually high numbers of genetic variants associated with complex traits, including BP, that are located in non-coding areas suggest an involvement of these variants in regulatory functions. This may involve differential regulation of expression in different tissues. Emerging evidence indicates that the ENaC plays an important role in BP determination not only via its actions in the kidney, but also in other tissues commonly involved in BP regulation. The ENaC in the central nervous system is proposed to regulate BP via sympathetic nervous system activity. Recent evidence suggests that the ENaC contributes to vascular function and the myogenic response. Additional roles potentially include initiation of the baroreceptor reflex via ENaC in the baroreceptors and driving high salt intake with a ?taste for salt? via ENaC in the tongue. The present review describes the involvement of the ENaC in the determination of BP at a genetic and physiological level, detailing recent evidence for its role in the kidney and in other pertinent tissues.},

This regulation is achieved through cell surface insertion/retrieval of channels, by changes in channel open probability (Po), or through a combination of these processes. Epithelium-derived serine proteases, including channel activating protease (CAP) and prostasin, regulate epithelial Na+ transport, but the molecular mechanism is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that extracellular serine proteases activate a near-silent ENaC population resident in the plasma membrane. Single-channel events were recorded in outside-out patches from fibroblasts (NIH/3T3) stably expressing rat α-, ?-, and ?-subunits (rENaC), before and during exposure to trypsin, a serine protease homologous to CAP and prostasin. Under baseline conditions, near-silent patches were defined as having rENaC activity (NPo) {$<$} 0.03, where N is the number of channels. Within 1?5 min of 3 ?g/ml bath trypsin superfusion, NPo increased ?66-fold (n = 7). In patches observed to contain a single functional channel, trypsin increased Po from 0.02 ± 0.01 to 0.57 ± 0.03 (n = 3, mean ± SE), resulting from the combination of an increased channel open time and decreased channel closed time. Catalytic activity was required for activation of near-silent ENaC. Channel conductance and the Na+/Li+ current ratio with trypsin were similar to control values. Modulation of ENaC Po by endogenous epithelial serine proteases is a potentially important regulator of epithelial Na+ transport, distinct from the regulation achieved by hormone-induced plasma membrane insertion of channels.}

Low micromolar concentrations of human neutrophil elastase (hNE) applied to the apical surface of a human bronchial cell line (16HBE14o-/??) increased Na+ transport about twofold. Similar effects were observed with trypsin, also a serine protease. Proteolytic inhibitors of hNE or trypsin selectively abolished the enzyme-induced increase of epithelial Na+ transport. At the level of the single channel, submicromolar concentrations of hNE increased activity of near-silent ENaC ?108-fold in patches from NIH-3T3 cells expressing rat α-, ?-, and ?-ENaC subunits. However, no enzyme effects were observed on basally active ENaCs. Trypsin exposure following hNE revealed no additional increase in amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current or in ENaC activity, suggesting these enzymes share a common mode of action for increasing Na+ transport, likely through proteolytic activation of ENaC. The hNE-induced increase of near-silent ENaC activity in CF airways could contribute to Na+ hyperabsorption, reduced airway surface liquid height, and dehydrated mucus culminating in inefficient mucociliary clearance.}

  abstract = {Summary Low-dose images obtained by electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) are often affected by blurring caused by sample motion during electron beam exposure, degrading signal especially at high resolution. We show here that we can align frames of movies, recorded with a direct electron detector during beam exposure of rotavirus double-layered particles, thereby greatly reducing image blurring caused by beam-induced motion and sample stage instabilities. This procedure increases the efficiency of cryo-EM imaging and enhances the resolution obtained in three-dimensional reconstructions of the particle. Using movies in this way is generally applicable to all cryo-EM samples and should also improve the performance of midrange electron microscopes that may have limited mechanical stability and beam coherence.}

We have identified the primary structure of the α-subunit of the rat epithelial sodium channel by expression cloning in Xenopus laevis oocytes3. An identical subunit has recently been reported4. Here we identify two other subunits (β and γ) by functional complementation of the α-subunit of the rat epithelial Na+ channel. The ion-selective permeability, the gating properties and the pharmacological profile of the channel formed by coexpressing the three subunits in oocytes are similar to that of the native channel.}

Reabsorbtion of sodium through this channel, which is regulated by hormones such as aldosterone and vasopressin, is one of the essential mechanisms involved in the regulation of sodium balance, blood volume and blood pressure1–6. Here we isolate a DNA from epithelial cells of rat distal colon and identify it by functional expression of an amiloride-sensitive sodium current in Xenopus oocyte. The deduced polypeptide (698 amino acids) has at least two putative transmembrane segments. Expression of this protein in Xenopus oocytes reconstitutes the functional properties of the highly selective amiloride-sensitive, epithelial sodium channel. The gene encoding this rat sodium channel subunit shares significant sequence similarity with mec-4 and deg-1, members of a family of Caenorhabditis elegans genes involved in sensory touch transduction and, when mutated, neuronal degeneration. We propose that the gene products of these three genes are members of a gene family coding for cation channels.}

Here we present an analysis of Nedd4-null mice to show that loss of Nedd4 results in reduced insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin signaling, delayed embryonic development, reduced growth and body weight, and neonatal lethality. In mouse embryonic fibroblasts, mitogenic activity was reduced, the abundance of the adaptor protein Grb10 was increased, and the IGF-1 receptor, which is normally present on the plasma membrane, was mislocalized. However, surface expression of IGF-1 receptor was restored in homozygous mutant mouse embryonic fibroblasts after knockdown of Grb10, and Nedd4−/− lethality was rescued by maternal inheritance of a disrupted Grb10 allele. Thus, in vivo, Nedd4 appears to positively control IGF-1 and insulin signaling partly through the regulation of Grb10 function.}

  abstract = {Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) mediate Na+ entry across the apical membrane of high resistance epithelia that line the distal nephron, airway and alveoli, and distal colon. These channels are composed of three homologous subunits, termed α, β, and γ, which have intracellular amino and carboxyl termini and two membrane-spanning domains connected by large extracellular loops. Maturation of ENaC subunits involves furin-dependent cleavage of the extracellular loops at two sites within the α subunit and at a single site within the γ subunit. The α subunits must be cleaved twice, immediately following Arg-205 and Arg-231, in order for channels to be fully active. Channels lacking α subunit cleavage are inactive with a very low open probability. In contrast, channels lacking both α subunit cleavage and the tract αAsp-206-Arg-231 are active when expressed in oocytes, suggesting that αAsp-206-Arg-231 functions as an inhibitor that stabilizes the channel in the closed conformation. A synthetic 26-mer peptide (α-26), corresponding to αAsp-206-Arg-231, reversibly inhibits wild-type mouse ENaCs expressed in Xenopus oocytes, as well as endogenous Na+ channels expressed in either a mouse collecting duct cell line or primary cultures of human airway epithelial cells. The IC50 for amiloride block of ENaC was not affected by the presence of α-26, indicating that α-26 does not bind to or interact with the amiloride binding site. Substitution of Arg residues within α-26 with Glu, or substitution of Pro residues with Ala, significantly reduced the efficacy of α-26. The peptide inhibits ENaC by reducing channel open probability. Our results suggest that proteolysis of the α subunit activates ENaC by disassociating an inhibitory domain (αAsp-206-Arg-231) from its effector site within the channel complex.}

Cleavage of the ?-subunit by furin at the consensus site ?RKRR143 and subsequent cleavage by a second protease at a distal site strongly activate the channel. For example, coexpression of prostasin with ENaC increases both channel function and cleavage at the ?RKRK186 site. We generated a polyclonal antibody that recognizes the region 144?186 in the ?-subunit (anti-?43) to determine whether prostasin promotes the release of the intervening tract between the putative furin and ?RKRK186 cleavage sites. Anti-?43 precipitated both full-length (93 kDa) and furin-processed (83 kDa) ?-subunits from extracts obtained from oocytes expressing α?HA-?-V5 channels, but only the full-length (93 kDa) ?-subunit from oocytes expressing α?HA-?-V5 channels and either wild-type or a catalytically inactive prostasin. Although both wild-type and catalytically inactive prostasin activated ENaCs in an aprotinin-sensitive manner, only wild-type prostasin bound to aprotinin beads, suggesting that catalytically inactive prostasin facilitates the cleavage of the ?-subunit by an endogenous protease in Xenopus oocytes. As dietary salt restriction increases cleavage of the renal ?-subunit, we assessed release of the 43-mer inhibitory tract on rats fed a low-Na+ diet. We found that a low-Na+ diet increased ?-subunit cleavage detected with the anti-? antibody and dramatically reduced the fraction precipitated with the anti-?43 antibody. Our results suggest that the inhibitory tract dissociates from the ?-subunit in kidneys from rats on a low-Na+ diet.}

  abstract = {Protons regulate electrogenic sodium absorption in a variety of epithelia, including the cortical collecting duct, frog skin, and urinary bladder. Recently, three subunits (α, ?, ?) coding for the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) were cloned. However, it is not known whether pH regulates Na+ channels directly by interacting with one of the three ENaC subunits or indirectly by interacting with a regulatory protein. As a first step to identifying the molecular mechanisms of proton-mediated regulation of apical membrane Na+ permeability in epithelia, we examined the effect of pH on the biophysical properties of ENaC. To this end, we expressed various combinations of α-, ?-, and ?-subunits of ENaC in Xenopusoocytes and studied ENaC currents by the two-electrode voltage-clamp and patch-clamp techniques. In addition, the effect of pH on the α-ENaC subunit was examined in planar lipid bilayers. We report that α,?,?-ENaC currents were regulated by changes in intracellular pH (pHi) but not by changes in extracellular pH (pHo). Acidification reduced and alkalization increased channel activity by a voltage-independent mechanism. Moreover, a reduction of pHi reduced single-channel open probability, reduced single-channel open time, and increased single-channel closed time without altering single-channel conductance. Acidification of the cytoplasmic solution also inhibited α,?-ENaC, α,?-ENaC, and α-ENaC currents. We conclude that pHi but not pHo regulates ENaC and that the α-ENaC subunit is regulated directly by pHi.}

Here, we have identified a new ACK1-binding partner, the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2, which binds ACK1 via a conserved PPXY-containing region. We show that this motif also binds Nedd4-related proteins and several other WW domain-containing proteins, including the tumor suppressor oxidoreductase Wwox. In HeLa cells ACK1 colocalizes with Nedd4-2 in clathrin-rich vesicles, requiring this PPXY motif. Nedd4-2 strongly down-regulates ACK1 levels when coexpressed, and this process can be blocked by proteasome inhibitor MG132. ACK1 degradation via Nedd4 requires their mutual interaction and a functional E3 ligase; it is also driven by ACK1 activity. ACK1 is polyubiquitinated in vivo, and dominant inhibitory Nedd4 blocks endogenous ACK1 turnover in response to acute EGF treatment. Because EGF stimulation activates ACK1 ( Galisteo, M., Y., Y., Urena, J., and Schlessinger, J. (2006) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 103, 9796-9801 ), our result suggest that EGF receptor-mediated ACK1 activation allows Nedd4-2 to drive kinase degradation. Thus the interplay between Nedd4-2-related E3 ligases that regulate ACK1 levels and Cbl that modifies EGF receptor impinges on cell receptor dynamics. These processes are particularly pertinent given the report of genomic amplification of the ACK1 locus in metastatic tumors.}

Now mice genetically engineered to lack the drug's target sodium channel, ENaC, in taste receptor neurons have been found to lack both salt sensing and sodium taste responses. Thus sodium sensing, like the four other taste modalities (sweet, sour, bitter and umami), is mediated by dedicated taste-receptor cells. Though because sodium sensing is amiloride-insensitive in primates, how this relates to our ability to taste salt remains unclear.}

This multiubiquitin chain is linked to one of two specific Lys residues in beta gal. These same Lys residues have been identified by molecular genetic analysis as components of the aminoterminal degradation signal in beta gal. The experiments with ubiquitin mutated at its Lys48 residue indicate that the multiubiquitin chain in a targeted protein is essential for the degradation of the protein.}

CFTR−/− pigs spontaneously develop lung disease resembling human CF. At birth, their airways exhibit a bacterial host defense defect, but are not inflamed. Therefore, we studied ion transport in newborn nasal and tracheal/bronchial epithelia in tissues, cultures, and in~vivo. CFTR−/− epithelia showed markedly reduced Cl- and HCO3- transport. However, in contrast to a widely held view, lack of CFTR did not increase transepithelial Na+ or liquid absorption or reduce periciliary liquid depth. Like human CF, CFTR−/− pigs showed increased amiloride-sensitive voltage and current, but lack of apical Cl- conductance caused the change, not increased Na+ transport. These results indicate that CFTR provides the predominant transcellular pathway for Cl- and HCO3- in porcine airway epithelia, and reduced anion permeability may initiate CF airway disease.},

  abstract = {The regulation of the open probability of the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) by the extracellular concentration of Na+, a phenomenon called “Na+ self inhibition,” has been well described in several natural tight epithelia, but its molecular mechanism is not known. We have studied the kinetics of Na+ self inhibition on human ENaC expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Rapid removal of amiloride or rapid increase in the extracellular Na+ concentration from 1 to 100 mM resulted in a peak inward current followed by a decline to a lower quasi-steady-state current. The rate of current decline and the steady-state level were temperature dependent and the current transient could be well explained by a two-state (active-inactive) model with a weakly temperature-dependent (Q10act = 1.5) activation rate and a strongly temperature-dependant (Q10inact = 8.0) inactivation rate. The steep temperature dependence of the inactivation rate resulted in the paradoxical decrease in the steady-state amiloride-sensitive current at high temperature. Na+ self inhibition depended only on the extracellular Na+ concentration but not on the amplitude of the inward current, and it was observed as a decrease of the conductance at the reversal potential for Na+ as well as a reduction of Na+ outward current. Self inhibition could be prevented by exposure to extracellular protease, a treatment known to activate ENaC or by treatment with p-CMB. After protease treatment, the amiloride-sensitive current displayed the expected increase with rising temperature. These results indicate that Na+ self inhibition is an intrinsic property of sodium channels resulting from the expression of the α, β, and γ subunits of human ENaC in Xenopus oocyte. The extracellular Na+-dependent inactivation has a large energy of activation and can be abolished by treatment with extracellular proteases.}

  abstract = {We have investigated the effect of extracellular proteases on the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current (INa) in Xenopus oocytes expressing the three subunits α, β, and γ of the rat or Xenopus epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). Low concentrations of trypsin (2 μg/ml) induced a large increase of INa within a few minutes, an effect that was fully prevented by soybean trypsin inhibitor, but not by amiloride. A similar effect was observed with chymotrypsin, but not with kallikrein. The trypsin-induced increase of INa was observed with Xenopus and rat ENaC, and was very large (∼20-fold) with the channel obtained by coexpression of the α subunit of Xenopus ENaC with the β and γ subunits of rat ENaC. The effect of trypsin was selective for ENaC, as shown by the absence of effect on the current due to expression of the K+ channel ROMK2. The effect of trypsin was not prevented by intracellular injection of EGTA nor by pretreatment with GTP-γS, suggesting that this effect was not mediated by G proteins. Measurement of the channel protein expression at the oocyte surface by antibody binding to a FLAG epitope showed that the effect of trypsin was not accompanied by an increase in the channel protein density, indicating that proteolysis modified the activity of the channel present at the oocyte surface rather than the cell surface expression. At the single channel level, in the cell-attached mode, more active channels were observed in the patch when trypsin was present in the pipette, while no change in channel activity could be detected when trypsin was added to the bath solution around the patch pipette. We conclude that extracellular proteases are able to increase the open probability of the epithelial sodium channel by an effect that does not occur through activation of a G protein-coupled receptor, but rather through proteolysis of a protein that is either a constitutive part of the channel itself or closely associated with it.}

  abstract = {The proprotein processing activity of mutants of the subtilisin-like enzyme furin was studied in transfected mammalian cells. Our studies indicate that the three residues of the catalytic triad of furin, Asp46, His87, and Ser261, are critical not only for substrate processing but also for maturation of furin. Furthermore, evidence is provided that maturation of furin occurs through an intramolecular autocatalytic process. Substitution of the asparagine residue (Asn188) of the oxyanion hole by an alanine residue appears to block substrate processing but not furin maturation. Analysis of carboxyl-terminal deletion mutants revealed that the segment encompassing residues Glu449 to Glu469 of the "middle" domain, which is more than 100 residues downstream of the predicted catalytic domain, contains residues that seem to be critical for processing activity but that the more carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich region, the transmembrane region, and the cytosolic tail are dispensable. Finally, we made mutants in the substrate binding region of human furin and studied their ability to process von Willebrand factor (pro-vWF) substrates, including wild-type pro-vWF as well as pro-vWF mutants in which the P1 (vWFR-1G), P2 (vWFK-2A), or P4 (vWFR-4A) basic residue with respect to the pro region cleavage site had been mutated. It is demonstrated that particular negatively charged residues in or near the substrate binding region of furin are critical for cleavage activity and specificity of the enzyme for multiple basic residues in the substrate. Furthermore, substrate binding region mutants of furin were obtained, which cleaved either the pro-vWFK-2A or pro-vWFR-4A mutant of pro-vWF more efficiently than wild-type pro-vWF.}

In addition, common validation tasks are accelerated and visualized in real time. Using the recently described 3.8 A resolution cryo-EM structure of the eukaryotic minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicase complex as a case study, it is demonstrated how ISOLDE can be used alongside other modern refinement tools to avoid common pitfalls of low-resolution modelling and improve the quality of the final model. A detailed analysis of changes between the initial and final model provides a somewhat sobering insight into the dangers of relying on a small number of validation metrics to judge the quality of a low-resolution model.},

  abstract = {Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experienced game-changing hardware and software advances about a decade ago. Since then, there have been gradual and steady improvements in experimental and data analysis methods. Nonetheless, structural analysis of nonsymmetric membrane proteins, such as G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), remains challenging. Their relatively low molecular weight and obstruction by the micelle/nanodisc result in marginal signal levels, which combined with the intrinsic flexibility of such complexes creates difficult structural study scenarios. Pushing the performance limits of cryo-EM requires careful optimization of all experimental aspects. To this end, it is necessary to build quantitative knowledge of the effect each parameter has on the outcome. Here, we present in-depth analysis of the influence of the main cryo-EM experimental factors on the performance for GPCR structure determination. We used a tandem experiment approach that combined real-world structural studies with parameter testing. We quantified the effects of using a Volta phase plate, zero-loss energy filtering, objective lens aperture, defocus magnitude, total exposure, and grid type. Through such systematic optimization of the experimental conditions, it has been possible to routinely determine class B1 GPCR structures at resolutions better than 2.5 Å. The improved fidelity of such maps helps to build higher confidence atomic models and will be crucial for the future expansion of cryo-EM into the structure-based drug design domain. The optimization guidelines drafted here are not limited to GPCRs and can be applied directly for the study of other challenging membrane protein targets.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {We describe a phase plate for transmission electron microscopy taking advantage of a hitherto-unknown phenomenon, namely a beam-induced Volta potential on the surface of a continuous thin film. The Volta potential is negative, indicating that it is not caused by beam-induced electrostatic charging. The film must be heated to ?200 °C to prevent contamination and enable the Volta potential effect. The phase shift is created ?on the fly? by the central diffraction beam eliminating the need for precise phase plate alignment. Images acquired with the Volta phase plate (VPP) show higher contrast and unlike Zernike phase plate images no fringing artifacts. Following installation into the microscope, the VPP has an initial settling time of about a week after which the phase shift behavior becomes stable. The VPP has a long service life and has been used for more than 6 mo without noticeable degradation in performance. The mechanism underlying the VPP is the same as the one responsible for the degradation over time of the performance of thin-film Zernike phase plates, but in the VPP it is used in a constructive way. The exact physics and/or chemistry behind the process causing the Volta potential are not fully understood, but experimental evidence suggests that radiation-induced surface modification combined with a chemical equilibrium between the surface and residual gases in the vacuum play an important role.}

Specific mutations inactivating PY motifs in ENaC C termini cause Liddle's syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Previously we showed that these PY motifs serve as binding sites for the E3 enzyme Nedd4-2, implying ubiquitination as a regulatory mechanism of ENaC. Ubiquitination involves the sequential action of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes. Here we identify the E2 enzyme UBE2E3, which acts in concert with Nedd4-2, and show by coimmunoprecipitation that UBE2E3 and Nedd4-2 interact together. In Xenopus laevis oocytes, UBE2E3 reduces ENaC activity marginally, consistent with Nedd4-2 being the rate-limiting factor in this process, whereas a catalytically inactive mutant of UBE2E3 (UBE2E3-CS) causes elevated ENaC activity by increasing cell surface expression. No additive effect is observed when UBE2E3-CS is coexpressed with an inactive Nedd4-2 mutant, and the stimulatory role of UBE2E3-CS depends on the integrity of the PY motifs (Nedd4-2 binding sites) and the ubiquitination sites on ENaC. In renal mpkCCDcl4 cells, displaying ENaC-dependent transepithelial Na+ transport, Nedd4-2 and UBE2E3 can be coimmunoprecipitated and overexpression of UBE2E3 affects Na+ transport, corroborating the concept of a concerted action of UBE2E3 and Nedd4-2 in ENaC regulation.}

We investigated the effect of extracellular  proteases on rat ENaC heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes.  Application of trypsin increased ENaC whole-oocyte currents by about 8-fold  without a concomitant increase in channel surface expression. The stimulatory  effect of trypsin was preserved in oocytes expressing alphagamma-ENaC, but was  abolished in oocytes expressing alphabeta-ENaC. Thus, the gamma-subunit appears  to be essential for channel activation by extracellular proteases. Site-directed  mutagenesis of a putative prostasin cleavage site in the extracellular loop of  the gamma-subunit revealed that mutating the 181Lys residue to alanine  (gammaK181A) increases ENaC baseline whole-oocyte currents, decreases channel  surface expression, and largely reduces the stimulatory effect of extracellular  proteases (trypsin, chymotrypsin and human neutrophil elastase). In  single-channel recordings from outside-out patches we demonstrated that the  gammaK181A mutation essentially abolishes the activation of near-silent channels  by trypsin, while a stimulatory effect of trypsin on channel gating is preserved.  This apparent dual effect of trypsin on channel gating and on the recruitment of  near-silent channels was confirmed by experiments using the beta518C mutant ENaC  which can be converted to a channel with an open probability of nearly one by  exposure to a sulfhydryl reagent. Interestingly, the gammaK181A mutation results  in the spontaneous appearance of a 67 kDa fragment of the gamma-subunit in the  plasma membrane which can be prevented by a furin inhibitor and also occurs after  channel activation by extracellular trypsin. This suggests that the mutation  promotes channel cleavage and activation by endogenous proteases. This would  lower the pool of near-silent channels and explain the constitutive activation  and reduced responsiveness of the mutant channel to extracellular proteases. We  conclude that the mutated site (K181A) affects a region in the gamma-subunit of  ENaC that is functionally important for the activation of near-silent channels by  extracellular proteases.},

  abstract = {Relatively large values of objective-lens defocus must normally be used to produce detectable levels of image contrast for unstained biological specimens, which are generally weak phase objects. As a result, a subsequent restoration operation must be used to correct for oscillations in the contrast transfer function (CTF) at higher resolution. Currently used methods of CTF correction assume the ideal case in which Friedel mates in the scattered wave have contributed pairs of Fourier components that overlap with one another in the image plane. This “ideal” situation may be only poorly satisfied, or not satisfied at all, as the particle size gets smaller, the defocus value gets larger, and the resolution gets higher. We have therefore investigated whether currently used methods of CTF correction are also effective in restoring the single-sideband image information that becomes displaced (delocalized) by half (or more) the diameter of a particle of finite size. Computer simulations are used to show that restoration either by “phase flipping” or by multiplying by the CTF recovers only about half of the delocalized information. The other half of the delocalized information goes into a doubly defocused “twin” image of the type produced during optical reconstruction of an in-line hologram. Restoration with a Wiener filter is effective in recovering the delocalized information only when the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) is orders of magnitude higher than that which exists in low-dose images of biological specimens, in which case the Wiener filter approaches division by the CTF (i.e. the formal inverse). For realistic values of the S/N, however, the “twin image” problem seen with a Wiener filter is very similar to that seen when either phase flipping or multiplying by the CTF is used for restoration. The results of these simulations suggest that CTF correction is a poor alternative to using a Zernike-type phase plate when imaging biological specimens, in which case the images can be recorded in a close-to-focus condition, and delocalization of high-resolution information is thus minimized.},

To determine whether rENaC could account for sodium absorption in vivo, we studied the cellular localization of the sodium channel messenger RNA subunits by in situ hybridization and their cellular and subcellular distribution by immunocytochemistry in the kidney, colon, salivary, and sweat glands of the rat. In the kidney, we show that the three subunit mRNAs are specifically co-expressed in the renal distal convoluted tubules (DCT), connecting tubules (CNT), cortical collecting ducts (CCD), and outer medullary collecting ducts (OMCD), but not in the inner medullary collecting ducts (IMCD). We demonstrate co-localization of alpha, beta, and gamma subunit proteins in the apical membrane of a majority of cells of CCD and OMCD. Our data indicate that alpha, beta, and gamma subunit mRNAs and proteins are co-expressed in the distal nephron (excepting IMCD), a localization that correlates with the previously described physiological expression of amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium transport. Our data, however, suggest that another sodium transport protein mediates electrogenic amiloride-sensitive sodium reabsorption in IMCD. We also localized rENaC to the surface epithelial cells of the distal colon and to the secretory ducts of the salivary gland and sweat gland, providing further evidence consistent with the hypothesis that the highly selective, amiloride-sensitive sodium channel is physiologically expressed in aldosterone-responsive cells.}

Here, we investigate the role of the yeast Nedd4 homologue, Rsp5, in protein sorting into vesicles that bud into the multivesicular endosome (MVE) en route to the vacuole. A mutant lacking the Rsp5 C2 domain is unable to ubiquitinate or sort biosynthetic cargo into MVE vesicles, whereas endocytic cargo is ubiquitinated and sorted efficiently. The C2 domain binds specifically to phosphoinositides in vitro and is sufficient for localization to membranes in intact cells. Mutation of a lysine-rich patch on the surface of the C2 domain abolishes membrane interaction and disrupts sorting of biosynthetic cargo. Translational fusion of ubiquitin to a biosynthetic cargo protein alleviates the requirement for the C2 domain in its MVE sorting. These results demonstrate that the C2 domain specifies Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination of endosomal cargo and suggest that Rsp5 function is regulated by membrane phosphoinositides.}

Recently, techniques have been developed to identify palmitoylation on a proteome-wide scale in order to reveal the full cellular complement of palmitoylated proteins. However, in the studies reported to date, there is considerable variation between the sets of identified palmitoyl-proteins and so there remains some uncertainty over what constitutes the definitive complement of palmitoylated proteins even in well-studied tissues such as brain. To address this issue, we used both acyl-biotin exchange and acyl-resin-assisted capture approaches using rat brain as a common protein source. The palmitoyl-proteins identified from each method by mass spectrometry were then compared with each other and previously published studies. There was generally good agreement between the two methods, although many identifications were unique to one method, indicating that at least some of the variability in published palmitoyl proteomes is due to methodological differences. By combining our new data with previous publications using mammalian cells/tissues, we propose a high confidence set of bona fide palmitoylated proteins in brain and provide a resource to help researchers prioritise candidate palmitoyl-proteins for investigation.}

Conventional structural methods such as X-ray crystallography and cryo-transmission electron microscopy can identify metal atoms on protein only if the protein structure is solved to atomic resolution. We demonstrate here the detection of isolated atoms of Zn and Fe on ferritin, using cryogenic annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) coupled with single-particle 3D reconstructions. Zn atoms are found in a pattern that matches precisely their location at the ferroxidase sites determined earlier by X-ray crystallography. By contrast, the Fe distribution is smeared along an arc corresponding to the proposed path from the ferroxidase sites to the mineral nucleation sites along the twofold axes. In this case the single-particle reconstruction is interpreted as a probability distribution function based on the average of individual locations. These results establish conditions for detection of isolated metal atoms in the broader context of electron cryo-microscopy and tomography.},

  abstract = {Epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) are located on the apical surface of cells and funnel Na+ ions from the lumen into the cell. ENaC function also regulates extracellular fluid volume as water flows across membranes accompanying Na+ ions to maintain osmolarity. To examine the sites of expression and intracellular localization of ENaC, we generated polyclonal antibodies against the extracellular domain of human α-ENaC subunit that we expressed in E. coli. Three-dimensional (3D) confocal microscopy of immunofluorescence using these antibodies for the first time revealed that ENaCs are uniformly distributed on the ciliary surface in all epithelial cells with motile cilia lining the bronchus in human lung and female reproductive tract, all along the fimbrial end of the fallopian tube, the ampulla and rare cells in the uterine glands. Quantitative analysis indicated that cilia increase cell surface area {$>$}70-fold and the amount of ENaC on cilia is {$>$}1,000-fold higher than on non-ciliated cell surface. These findings indicate that ENaC functions as a regulator of the osmolarity of the periciliary fluid bathing the cilia. In contrast to ENaC, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) that channels chloride ions from the cytoplasm to the lumen is located mainly on the apical side, but not on cilia. The cilial localization of ENaC requires reevaluation of the mechanisms of action of CFTR and other modulators of ENaC function. ENaC on motile cilia should be essential for diverse functions of motile cilia, such as germ cell transport, fertilization, implantation, clearance of respiratory airways and cell migration.}

  abstract = {Aldosterone-induced sodium absorption is mediated by the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC). It is thought that the ?early effect? is not based on genomic regulation of ENaC expression, because ENaC subunit transcription was reported to start later than Na+ transport. We investigated electrogenic Na+ absorption (J Na) and, in identical tissues, mRNA expression of ENaC subunits in early (EDC) and late (LDC) distal colon of the rat. In both segments, 8-h in vitro incubation with 3 nM aldosterone enhanced expression of ?- and ?-ENaC mRNA and induced J Na.J Na was 10 times higher in LDC than in EDC. α-ENaC mRNA was unchanged in EDC, whereas it decreased in LDC. In LDC, ?- and ?-ENaC mRNA was induced 1 h after aldosterone addition, whereas J Na became apparent {$>$}1 h later. Downregulation of α-ENaC mRNA did not take part in acute regulation because it started after a lag time of 3 h. Time correlation of ?- and ?-ENaC induction and J Na stimulation suggests that the early aldosterone effect on Na+ absorption in distal colon is caused by transcriptional upregulation of ?- and ?-ENaC expression.}

  abstract = {Summary We investigated the mechanisms of activation and~degradation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4L combining the available biochemical information with complementary biophysical techniques. Using nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we identified that the C2 domain binds Ca2+ and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) using the same interface that is used to interact with the HECT domain. Thus, we propose that the transition from the closed to the active form is regulated by a competition of IP3 and Ca2+ with the HECT domain for binding to the C2 domain. We performed relaxation experiments and molecular dynamic simulations to determine the flexibility of the HECT structure and observed that its conserved PY motif can become solvent-exposed when the unfolding process is initiated. The structure of the WW3 domain bound to the HECT-PY site reveals the details of this interaction, suggesting a~possible auto-ubquitination mechanism using two molecules, a partially unfolded one and a fully functional Nedd4L counterpart.}

  abstract = {Due to the increasing popularity of electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) in the structural analysis of large biological molecules and macro-molecular complexes and the need for simple, rapid and efficient readout, there is a persuasive need for improved detectors. Commercial detectors, based on phosphor/fibre optics-coupled CCDs, provide adequate performance for many applications, including electron diffraction. However, due to intrinsic light scattering within the phosphor, spatial resolution is limited. Careful measurements suggest that CCDs have superior performance at lower resolution while all agree that film is still superior at higher resolution. Consequently, new detectors are needed based on more direct detection, thus avoiding the intermediate light conversion step required for CCDs. Two types of direct detectors are discussed in this review. First, there are detectors based on hybrid technology employing a separate pixellated sensor and readout electronics connected with bump bonds—hybrid pixel detectors (HPDs). Second, there are detectors, which are monolithic in that sensor and readout are all in one plane (monolithic active pixel sensor, MAPS). Our discussion is centred on the main parameters of interest to cryoEM users, viz. detective quantum efficiency (DQE), resolution or modulation transfer function (MTF), robustness against radiation damage, speed of readout, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the number of independent pixels available for a given detector.}

This activity was correlated with changes in renal Na handling and in the maturation of epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) protein. Neither SGK1?/? mice nor paired SGK1+/+ animals expressed detectable channel activity, measured as amiloride-sensitive whole-cell current (INa), under control conditions with standard chow. Administration of aldosterone (0.5 ?g/h via osmotic minipump for 7 days) increased INa to a similar extent in SGK1+/+ (378 ± 61 pA/cell at ?100 mV) and in SGK1?/? (350 ± 57 pA/cell) animals. However, the maturation of ENaC, assessed as the ratio of cleaved to full-length forms of ?-ENaC, was more pronounced in SGK+/+ mice. The SGK1?/? animals exhibited a salt-wasting phenotype when kept on a low-Na diet for up to 2 days, losing significantly more Na in the urine than wild-type mice. Under these conditions, INa was enhanced more in SGK1?/? (94 ± 14 pA/cell) than in SGK+/+ (23 ± 5 pA/cell) genotypes. Despite the larger currents, the ratio of cleaved to full-length ?-ENaC was lower in the knockout animals. The mice also expressed a smaller amount of Na+-Cl? cotransporter protein under Na-depleted conditions. These results indicated that SGK1 is essential for optimal processing of ENaC but is not required for activation of the channel by aldosterone.}

  abstract = {Newly synthesized transmembrane proteins undergo a series of steps to ensure that only the required amount of correctly folded protein is localized to the membrane. The regulation of protein quality and its abundance at the membrane are often controlled by ubiquitination, a multistep enzymatic process that results in the attachment of ubiquitin, or chains of ubiquitin to the target protein. Protein ubiquitination acts as a signal for sorting, trafficking, and the removal of membrane proteins via endocytosis, a process through which multiple ubiquitin ligases are known to specifically regulate the functions of a number of ion channels, transporters, and signaling receptors. Endocytic removal of these proteins through ubiquitin-dependent endocytosis provides a way to rapidly downregulate the physiological outcomes, and defects in such controls are directly linked to human pathologies. Recent evidence suggests that ubiquitination is also involved in the shedding of membranes and associated proteins as extracellular vesicles, thereby not only controlling the cell surface levels of some membrane proteins, but also their potential transport to neighboring cells. In this review, we summarize the mechanisms and functions of ubiquitination of membrane proteins and provide specific examples of ubiquitin-dependent regulation of membrane proteins.}

  abstract = {SPECIFIC AIMSAll three subunits of the amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) contain PPxY motifs that interact with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligases Nedd4 and Nedd4?2. This interaction is necessary to mediate ubiquitination-dependent down-regulation of ENaC activity under high Na+. The main aim of the current study was to analyze the requirements of individual WW domains of Nedd4?2 in binding to specific ENaC subunits and in the regulation of ENaC function. We also report the identification of two novel Nedd4?2 isoforms.PRINCIPAL FINDINGS1. Two novel tissue-specific isoforms of Nedd4?2We have identified two differentially spliced Nedd4?2 transcripts in mice and humans. The two transcripts originate due to differential splicing of the 60 bp coding exon 7 of the gene encoding residues 236?255 of the Nedd4?2 protein. We have named the shorter isoform Nedd4?2?20, as it lacks 20 amino acid residues that lie just before the WW2 of Nedd4?2 protein. RT-PCR analysis of the two isoforms indicated that although some tissues, such as gut and lung, expressed both splice variants, the longer Nedd4?2 isoform was predominantly expressed in gut, lung, and kidney, whereas Nedd4?2?20 was present in most tissues examined except kidney. To test whether Nedd4?2 and Nedd4?2?20 differ in their ability to inhibit ENaC function, we used the Xenopus oocyte system. Coexpression of the three ENaC subunits resulted in large amiloride-sensitive whole-cell inward currents with ?Iami averaging 16.8 ± 1.0 ?A at a holding potential of ?60 mV. Coexpression of Nedd4?2?20 or Nedd4?2 reduced ?Iami on average by 90.9 ± 2.2\% or 85.6 ± 2.4\%, respectively. In contrast, coexpression of the catalytically inactive C/S mutants that lack ubiquitin-protein ligase activity of Nedd4?2?20 or Nedd4?2 had no significant effect on ?Iami. These results suggest that both Nedd4?2 isoforms have the ability to regulate ENaC.2. Nedd4?2 WW3 and WW4 bind all three ENaC subunitsNedd4?2 contains 4 WW domains. To test which of the Nedd4?2 WW domains mediate interaction with the ENaC subunits, we generated GST fusion proteins containing individual WW domains and their inactive mutants. Equal amounts of the affinity-purified GST-WW domain fusion proteins were immobilized on nitrocellulose membranes after separation by SDS-PAGE and probed with the 32P-labeled carboxyl termini of mouse ENaC subunits. A recombinant protein containing all four WW domains of mouse Nedd4?2 interacted with all three ENaC subunits (Fig. 1? ). All three ENaC subunits bound to WW3 and WW4 strongly, whereas no significant binding was seen to WW1 and WW2 (Fig. 1)? . None of the WW domain mutant proteins showed any binding, indicating that the signals in far-Western blots represent specific WW domain?ligand interactions (Fig. 1)? . To further characterize the relative affinities of interactions between Nedd4?2 WW domains and ENaC subunits we used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. The interactions exhibited very rapid on and off rates, precluding analysis on the basis of kinetics. Data were instead analyzed on the basis of the steady-state response. Consistent with the far-Western results, binding of WW1 to all of the subunits showed a response no greater than that seen with the same concentration of GST alone, indicating that WW1 binding to the ENaC subunits is extremely weak. WW2 binding to the ENaC subunits gave a response only just greater than that observed for GST. WW3 and WW4 bound all three ENaC subunits relatively strongly, binding by WW3 being consistently stronger than binding by WW4. Dissociation constants for WW3 and WW4 binding were in the high nanomolar to low micromolar range. The order of affinity of WW domains for ENaC subunits can be summarized as WW3 {$>$} WW4 {$>$} WW2 {$>$} WW1. There appeared to be little discrimination between the three ENaC subunits by the WW domains, although WW4 bound slightly better to α than to ? or ?. Figure 1.Far-Western analysis of binding between Nedd4?2 WW domains and ENaC subunits. ? 2 ?g of each affinity purified GST WW fusion pro ein was used in far-Western assays. A) Coomassie blue-stained WT and mutant (mut) GST-WW proteins. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and hybridized to 32P-labeled αENaC (B), ?ENaC (C), or ?ENaC (D) probes. Molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated. 3. Nedd4?2 WW domains 3 and 4 are required for the down-regulation of ENaCTo investigate which of the WW domains of Nedd4?2 are required to prevent inhibition of ENaC by high intracellular Na+, we used the whole-cell patch clamp technique with single mouse mandibular duct cells. A pipette solution rich in Na+ (70 mM) leads to almost complete inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current, which is mediated by Nedd4/Nedd4?2. The amiloride-sensitive Na+ current was first measured when the high (70 mM) Na+ pipette solution included a mixture of GST fusion proteins containing the four individual WW domains of mouse Nedd4?2. We found that chord conductance of the amiloride-sensitive current was the same as that observed with the zero Na+ pipette solution (Fig. 2? ). This demonstrates that even when the WW domains of Nedd4?2 are present as separate proteins, they prevent down-regulation of ENaC by intracellular Na+. We then investigated whether mixtures containing only three of the four WW domains of Nedd4?2 were able to prevent inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current by increased intracellular Na+. We found that when either a mixture of WW2, WW3, and WW4 or a mixture of WW1, WW3 and WW4 was present in the high Na+ pipette solution, the amiloride-sensitive current was identical to that measured with zero Na+ pipette solution (Fig. 2)? . Mixtures of WW1, WW2, and WW3 or of WW1, WW2, and WW4, on the other hand, were unable to prevent the inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current by the high Na+ pipette solution. The failure of the WW1, WW2, and WW3 mixture and of the WW1, WW2, and WW4 mixture to prevent Na+ feedback inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current indicates that WW1 and WW2 are not sufficient to prevent interaction of ENaC with endogenous Nedd4 or Nedd4?2. It also indicates that neither WW3 nor WW4 alone is sufficient to prevent this interaction. On the other hand, our finding that the two mixtures that contain WW3 as well as WW4 prevent Na+ feedback inhibition of ENaC indicates that WW3 and WW4 are both required to prevent the interaction between the channel and Nedd4/Nedd4?2. This was confirmed when we included a mixture of just WW3 and WW4 in the high Na+ pipette solution and found it was sufficient to prevent inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive current (Fig. 2)? . These studies thus indicated that WW3 and WW4 of Nedd4?2 must be present in the pipette solution to prevent down-regulation of ENaC by the endogenous Nedd4 or Nedd4?2. We had previously reported that in the case of mouse Nedd4, all three WW domains must be present in the pipette solution to prevent channel inhibition by high intracellular Na+. Given the high degree of homology of these proteins, this difference in behavior was so striking that we repeated some of the original experiments on Nedd4 to confirm them. We found that, as previously reported, a mixture of the two WW domains of mouse Nedd4 known to bind all three ENaC subunits in vitro (Nedd4 WW2 and Nedd4 WW3) did not prevent inhibition of the ENaC by the high Na+ pipette solution. A mixture of all three WW domains of Nedd4 was, however, able to prevent Na+ feedback regulation of the Na+ current (Fig. 2)? . Figure 2.The effects of Nedd4?2 or Nedd4 WW domains on the chord conductance of the amiloride-sensitive Na+ current. The whole-cell currents in salivary duct cells studied with 70 mM Na+ pipette solution plus a mixture of GST fusion proteins containing Nedd4?2 WW domains as follows. WW1?4 each at a concentration of 100 ?g/mL; a mixture of WW2 + WW3 + WW4, or WW1 + WW3 + WW4, or WW1 + WW2 + WW3, or WW1 + WW2 + WW4 each at a concentration of 133 ?g/mL; WW3 and WW4 each at a concentration of 200 ?g/mL. Nedd4 WW2 and WW3 (at 200 ?g/mL) or WW1?3 (each at 133 ?g/mL) were used in the 70 mM Na+ pipette solution. The dat are given as mean ± se, with the number of experiments shown in parentheses. The dotted line indicates mean chord conductance of the amiloride-sensitive current observed with zero Na+ (n=4). CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCEWe have described here the identification of two alternatively spliced forms of Nedd4?2 that differ in 20 amino acid residues inserted just upstream of WW2. These spliced forms are expressed in a highly tissue-specific manner, suggesting they may have tissue/cell-specific functions. Note that the long Nedd4?2 isoform is expressed mostly in tissues that express ENaC, such as kidney, gut, lung, and salivary gland. However, in Xenopus oocytes, both isoforms are able to inhibit ENaC function similarly, suggesting that the presence of 20 amino acids in Nedd4?2 does not have a significant effect on ENaC regulation. We believe that although both Nedd4?2 isoforms appear to inhibit ENaC similarly, they may differentially regulate other undiscovered tissue-specific targets in vivo.Our binding data indicate that WW3 and WW4 domains mediate the interaction between Nedd4?2 and ENaC subunits, whereas WW1 and WW2 do not show appreciable binding to any of the ENaC subunits (Fig. 1)? . These data differ from binding data with Nedd4, where WW1 does not bind ENaC subunits but all other WW domains do, albeit with varying affinities. Our SPR data suggest that WW domain-ENaC binding/dissociation kinetics is rapid and that WW3 has the highest affinity for all three ENaC subunits. Our whole-cell patch clamp results show that the presence of the Nedd4?2 WW3 and WW4 is necessary and sufficient to prevent down-regulation of ENaC by high intracellular Na+ in ENaC-expressing salivary epithelial cells (Fig. 3? ). This implies that of the 4 WW domains in Nedd4?2, only WW3 and WW4 play a critical role in Na+ feedback regulation of ENaC in mammalian cells. The data also suggest that Nedd4?2 WW3 and WW4 interact with distinct noninterchangeable sites in ENaC. Our study is the first report of the role of individual Nedd4?2 WW domains in the regulation of endogenous mammalian ENaC in ENaC-expressing cells. In contrast to our results with Nedd4?2, studies of the closely related mouse Nedd4 protein show that it uses three WW domains to interact with ENaC. In the case of mouse Nedd4, all three domains are involved in this interaction; for human Nedd4, which has four WW domains, WW2, WW3, and WW4 are required. Our previous studies on mouse mandibular cells indicated that GST-WW domains from mouse Nedd4 selectively interact with three distinct sites and that since WW1 of Nedd4 does not bind ENaC, one of the sites is not on the Na+ channel. The findings for Nedd4 and Nedd4?2 can thus be reconciled if either Nedd4?2 WW3 or WW4 is able to indiscriminately interact with two of the three sites that are the targets of the WW domains of Nedd4. Figure 3.A potential model of Nedd4?2-mediated ENaC regulation. Under high cytosolic Na+ conditions, Nedd4?2 binds with PY motifs in ENaC subunits via WW 3 and WW4. Our data suggest that WW3 and WW4 bind to distinct sites on ENaC subunits and that both domains are necessary for ENaC down-regulation. WW1 and WW2 may interact with other yet unknown protein(s). 1 To read the full text of this article, go to http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/doi/10.1096/fj.02-0497fje; to cite this article, use FASEB J.

Dysregulation of this process can lead to various disease states including cancer, neurodegeneration, and autoimmunity. It is the correction of these dysregulated pathways, as well as the enticing ability to manipulate protein stability, that have instigated intense research into the therapeutic control of protein ubiquitination. A major bottleneck in the development and validation of small molecule modulators is the availability of a suitable high-throughput assay for enzyme activity. Herein, we present a new assay, which we term UbiReal, that uses fluorescence polarization to monitor all stages of Ub conjugation and deconjugation in real time. We use the assay to validate a chemical inhibitor of the E1 ubiquitin-activating enzyme, as well as to assess the activities and specificities of E2s, E3s, and deubiquitinases. The sensitivity and accessibility of this approach make it an excellent candidate for high-throughput screens of activity modulators, as well as a valuable tool for basic research into the mechanisms of ubiquitin regulation.},

When animals were fed an Na-deficient diet for 1 wk, the amounts of epithelial Na channel (ENaC) beta-subunit (beta-ENaC) and gamma-subunit (gamma-ENaC) and Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) protein in the surface fraction increased relative to controls by 1.9-, 3.5-, and 1.5-fold, respectively. The amounts of the luminal Na/H exchanger (NHE3) and the luminal Na-K-2Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) did not change significantly. The increases in ENaC subunits were mimicked by administration of aldosterone for 1 wk, but the increase in NCC was not. When the animals were fed a high-Na (5\% NaCl) diet for 1 wk, the surface expression of beta-ENaC increased by 50\%, whereas that of the other membrane proteins did not change, relative to controls. The biochemical parameter most strongly affected by dietary Na was the abundance of the 65-kDa cleaved form of gamma-ENaC at the surface. This increased by 8.5-fold with Na depletion and decreased by 40\% with Na loading. The overall 14-fold change reflected regulation of the total abundance of the subunit as well as the fraction of the subunit protein in the cleaved form. We conclude that cleavage of gamma-ENaC and its expression at the apical surface play a major role in the regulation of renal Na reabsorption.},

  abstract = {1. The inward facing membranes of in vitro frog skin epithelium were depolarized with solutions of high K concentration. The electrical properties of the epithelium are then expected to be governed by the outward facing, Na-selective membrane. 2. In this state, the transepithelial voltage (V) was clamped to zero and step-changes of Na activity in the outer solution ((Na)o) were performed with a fast-flow chamber at constant ionic strength, while the short-circuit current was recorded. 3. At pre-selected times after a step-change of (Na)o the current response (I) to a fast voltage staircase was recorded. This procedure was repeated after blocking the Na channels with amiloride to obtain the current?voltage curve of transmembrane and paracellular shunt pathways. The current?voltage curve of the Na channels was computed by subtracting the shunt current from the total current. 4. The instantaneous INa?V curve thus obtained at a given (Na)o could easily be fitted with the constant field equation in the range between -50 and zero mV. This fit yielded approximate estimates of PNa, the Na? permeability of the Na-selective membrane (at this (Na)o) and the cellular Na activity, (Na)c. As residual properties of the serosal membrane were ignored the computed values are expected to underestimate the true ones. 5. At constant (Na)c, the steady-state value of 1/PNa increases linearly with (Na)o. Error analysis and the effect of drugs show that the dependence is not due to the residual properties of the inward facing membranes but reflects the true behaviour of PNa. 6. The steady-state PNa at a given (Na)o is smaller than the transient PNa observed right after a stepwise increase of (Na)o to this value. The time constant of PNa-relaxation is in the order of seconds. 7. In conclusion, Na transport through open Na-selective channels of the outward facing membrane of the stratum granulosum cells can be described as an electrodiffusion process which as such does not saturate with increasing (Na)o. However, when added to the outer border of the membrane Na causes a decrease of PNa within several seconds. It is considered that binding of Na results in closure of Na channels.}

  abstract = {We have recently reported that the yeast plasma membrane uracil permease undergoes cell‐surface ubiquitination, which is dependent on the Npi1/Rsp5 ubiquitin–protein ligase. Ubiquitination of this permease, like that of some other transporters and receptors, signals endocytosis of the protein, leading to its subsequent vacuolar degradation. This process does not involve the proteasome, which binds and degrades ubiquitin–protein conjugates carrying Lys48‐linked ubiquitin chains. The data presented here show that ubiquitination and endocytosis of uracil permease are impaired in yeast cells lacking the Doa4p ubiquitin–isopeptidase. Both processes were rescued by overexpression of wild‐type ubiquitin. Mutant ubiquitins carrying Lys→Arg mutations at Lys29 and Lys48 restored normal permease ubiquitination. In contrast, a ubiquitin mutated at Lys63 did not restore permease polyubiquitination. Ubiquitin–permease conjugates are therefore extended through the Lys63 of ubiquitin. When polyubiquitination through Lys63 is blocked, the permease still undergoes endocytosis, but at a reduced rate. We have thus identified a natural target of Lys63‐linked ubiquitin chains. We have also shown that monoubiquitination is sufficient to induce permease endocytosis, but that Lys63‐linked ubiquitin chains appear to stimulate this process.}

Such channels have been characterized in amphibian skin and urinary bladder, renal collecting duct, distal colon, sweat and salivary glands, lung, and taste buds. They mediate the first step of active Na+ reabsorption and play a major role in the maintenance of electrolyte and water homeostasis in all vertebrates. In the past, these channels were classified according to their biophysical and pharmacological properties. The recent cloning of the three homologous channel subunits denoted alpha-, beta-, and gamma-epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) has provided a molecular definition of at least one class of amiloride-blockable channels. Subsequent studies have established that ENaC is a major Na(+)-conducting pathway in both absorbing and secretory epithelia and is related to one type of channel involved in mechanosensation. This review summarizes the biophysical characteristics, molecular properties, and regulatory mechanisms of epithelial amiloride-blockable Na+ channels. Special emphasis is given to recent studies utilizing cloned ENaC subunits and purified amiloride-binding proteins.}

ENaC α, ? and ? subunits are abundantly expressed in epithelial tissues, where they have been well characterized. An ENaC δ subunit has also been described in the human nervous system, although its histological distribution pattern remains unexplored. We have now isolated a novel ENaC δ isoform (δ2) from human brain and studied the expression pattern of both the known (δ1) and the new (δ2) isoforms in the human and monkey telencephalon. ENaC δ2 is produced by a combination of alternative transcription start sites, a frame shift in exon 3 and alternative splicing of exon 4. It forms functional amiloride-sensitive sodium channels when co-expressed with ENaC ? and ? accessory subunits. Comparison with the classical ENaC channel (α??) indicates that the interaction between δ2, ? and ? is functionally inefficient. Both ENaC δ isoforms are widely expressed in pyramidal cells of the human and monkey cerebral cortex and in different neuronal populations of telencephalic subcortical nuclei, but double-labelling experiments demonstrated a low level of co-localization between isoforms (5?8\%), suggesting specific functional roles for each of them.},

In humans an additional δ-subunit (δ-hENaC) exists but little is known about its function. Using the Xenopus laevis oocyte expression system, we compared the functional properties of αβγ- and δβγ-hENaC and investigated whether δβγ-hENaC can be proteolytically activated. The amiloride-sensitive ENaC whole-cell current (ΔIami) was about 11-fold larger in oocytes expressing δβγ-hENaC than in oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC. The 2-fold larger single-channel Na+ conductance of δβγ-hENaC cannot explain this difference. Using a chemiluminescence assay, we demonstrated that an increased channel surface expression is also not the cause. Thus, overall channel activity of δβγ-hENaC must be higher than that of αβγ-hENaC. Experiments exploiting the properties of the known βS520C mutant ENaC confirmed this conclusion. Moreover, chymotrypsin had a reduced stimulatory effect on δβγ-hENaC whole-cell currents compared with its effect on αβγ-hENaC whole-cell currents (2-fold versus 5-fold). This suggests that the cell surface pool of so-called near-silent channels that can be proteolytically activated is smaller for δβγ-hENaC than for αβγ-hENaC. Proteolytic activation of δβγ-hENaC was associated with the appearance of a δ-hENaC cleavage product at the cell surface. Finally, we demonstrated that a short inhibitory 13-mer peptide corresponding to a region of the extracellular loop of human α-ENaC inhibited ΔIami in oocytes expressing αβγ-hENaC but not in those expressing δβγ-hENaC. We conclude that the δ-subunit of ENaC alters proteolytic channel activation and enhances base-line channel activity.}

ENaC dependent reabsorption of Na+ in the kidney tubules regulates extracellular fluid (ECF) volume and blood pressure by modulating osmolarity. In multi-ciliated cells, ENaC is located in cilia and plays an essential role in the regulation of epithelial surface liquid volume necessary for cilial transport of mucus and gametes in the respiratory and reproductive tracts respectively. The subunits that form ENaC (named as alpha, beta, gamma and delta, encoded by genes SCNN1A, SCNN1B, SCNN1G, and SCNN1D) are members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily. The earliest appearance of ENaC orthologs is in the genomes of the most ancient vertebrate taxon, Cyclostomata (jawless vertebrates) including lampreys, followed by earliest representatives of Gnathostomata (jawed vertebrates) including cartilaginous sharks. Among Euteleostomi (bony vertebrates), Actinopterygii (ray finned-fishes) branch has lost ENaC genes. Yet, most animals in the Sarcopterygii (lobe-finned fish) branch including Tetrapoda, amphibians and amniotes (lizards, crocodiles, birds, and mammals), have four ENaC paralogs. We compared the sequences of ENaC orthologs from 20 species and established criteria for the identification of ENaC orthologs and paralogs, and their distinction from other members of the ENaC/Degenerin superfamily, especially ASIC family. Differences between ENaCs and ASICs are summarized in view of their physiological functions and tissue distributions. Structural motifs that are conserved throughout vertebrate ENaCs are highlighted. We also present a comparative overview of the genotype–phenotype relationships in inherited diseases associated with ENaC mutations, including multisystem pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1B), Liddle syndrome, cystic fibrosis-like disease and essential hypertension.},

In kindred I, the propositus presented with renal salt wasting in infancy (vomiting, failure to thrive, short stature, hyponatremia, hyperkalemia) and responded dramatically to a high salt diet (2.5 g/day). Sodium supplementation was discontinued at the age of two. In seven additional family members from three generations, clinical expression of PHA varied from asymptomatic to moderate. In affected members (propositus, mother, and two brothers), hyperaldosteronism persisted over 13 yr; however, the PRA decreased gradually to near normal values. Persistent hyperaldosteronism in the face of a decrease in PRA indicated the development of tertiary hyperaldosteronism due to autonomously functioning zona glomerulosa. The pedigree was consistent with an autosomal dominant mode of transmission with variable expression.In kindred II, the propositus, who was the product of a consanguineous marriage, developed severe renal salt losing at age 9 days. She had also increased salivary and sweat electrolytes consistent with PHA resulting from multiple organ unresponsiveness to mineralocorticoids. Life threatening episodes of salt wasting recurred beyond the age of 2 yr. At 5 yr of age she still requires high amounts of salt supplements (14 g/day). A sister died at 9 days of age with PHA symptoms. Six close relatives (parents, three siblings, maternal uncle) showed no biochemical abnormalities. This pedigree was consistent with an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance.In view of the findings on these two kindreds and the analysis of those in the literature, we conclude that type I PHA includes two clinically and genetically distinct entities with either renal or multiple target organ defects.}

The carboxyl terminus of each ENaC subunit contains a PPxY motif which is necessary for interaction with the WW domains of the ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4. Disruption of this interaction, as in Liddle’s syndrome where mutations delete or alter the PY motif of either the β or γ subunits, results in increased ENaC activity. We have recently shown using the whole-cell patch clamp technique that Nedd4 mediates the ubiquitin-dependent down-regulation of Na+ channel activity in response to increased intracellular Na+. In this paper, we demonstrate that WW domains 2 and 3 bind α-, β-, and γ-ENaC with varying degrees of affinity, whereas WW domain 1 does not bind to any of the subunits. We further show using whole-cell patch clamp techniques that Nedd4-mediated down-regulation of ENaC in mouse mandibular duct cells involves binding of the WW domains of Nedd4 to three distinct sites. We propose that Nedd4-mediated down-regulation of Na+ channels involves the binding of WW domains 2 and 3 to the Na+channel and of WW domain 1 to an unknown associated protein.}

Post-translational palmitoylation is a reversible modification that regulates localization of many proteins. Here, we report that palmitoylation of the AMPA receptor regulates receptor trafficking. All AMPA receptor subunits are palmitoylated on two cysteine residues in their transmembrane domain (TMD) 2 and in their C-terminal region. Palmitoylation on TMD 2 is upregulated by the palmitoyl acyl transferase GODZ and leads to an accumulation of the receptor in the Golgi and a reduction of receptor surface expression. C-terminal palmitoylation decreases interaction of the AMPA receptor with the 4.1N protein and regulates AMPA- and NMDA-induced AMPA receptor internalization. Moreover, depalmitoylation of the receptor is regulated by activation of glutamate receptors. These data suggest that regulated palmitoylation of AMPA receptor subunits modulates receptor trafficking and may be important for synaptic plasticity.}

Although this process is known to decrease the expression of proteolytically processed active channels on the cell surface, it is unknown how [Na+]i alters ENaC cleavage. We show here that [Na+]i regulates the posttranslational processing of ENaC subunits during channel biogenesis. At times when [Na+]i is low, ENaC subunits develop mature N-glycans and are processed by proteases. Conversely, glycan maturation and sensitivity to proteolysis are reduced when [Na+]i is relatively high. Surface channels with immature N-glycans were not processed by endogenous channel activating proteases, nor were they sensitive to cleavage by exogenous trypsin. Biotin chase experiments revealed that the immature surface channels were not converted into mature cleaved channels following a reduction in [Na+]i. The hypothesis that [Na+]i regulates ENaC maturation within the biosynthetic pathways is further supported by the finding that Brefeldin A prevented the accumulation of processed surface channels following a reduction in [Na+]i. Therefore, increased [Na+]i interferes with ENaC N-glycan maturation and prevents the channel from entering a state that allows proteolytic processing.}

  abstract = {The exact subunit combinations of functional native acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs) have not been established yet, but both homomeric and heteromeric channels are likely to exist. To determine the ability of different subunits to assemble into heteromeric channels, a number of ASIC1a-, ASIC1b-, ASIC2a-, ASIC2b-, and ASIC3-containing homo- and heteromeric channels were studied by whole-cell patch clamp recordings with respect to pH sensitivity, desensitization kinetics, and level of sustained current normalized to peak current. Analyzing and comparing data for these three features demonstrated unique heteromeric channels in a number of co-expression experiments. Formation of heteromeric ASIC1a+2a and ASIC1b+2a channels was foremost supported by the desensitization characteristics that were independent of proton concentration, a feature none of the respective homomeric channels has. Several lines of evidence supported formation of ASIC1a+3, ASIC1b+3, and ASIC2a+3 heteromeric channels. The most compelling was the desensitization characteristics, which, besides being proton-independent, were faster than those of any of the respective homomeric channels. ASIC2b, which homomerically expressed is not activated by protons per se, did not appear to form unique heteromeric combinations with other subunits and in fact appeared to suppress the function of ASIC1b. Co-expression of three subunits such as ASIC1a+2a+3 and ASIC1b+2a+3 resulted in data that could best be explained by coexistence of multiple channel populations within the same cell. This observation seems to be in good agreement with the fact that ASIC-expressing sensory neurons display a variety of acid-evoked currents.}

  abstract = {We previously showed that ENaC is present in lipid rafts in A6 cells, a Xenopus kidney cell line. We now demonstrate that ENaC can be detected in lipid rafts in mouse cortical collecting duct (MPKCCD14) cells by detergent insolubility, buoyancy on density gradients using two distinct approaches, and colocalization with caveolin 1. Less than 30\% of ENaC subunits were found in raft fractions. The channel subunits also colocalized on sucrose gradients with known vesicle targeting and fusion proteins syntaxin 1A, Vamp 2, and SNAP23. Hormonal stimulation of ENaC activity by either forskolin or aldosterone, short or long term, did not alter the lipid raft distribution of ENaC. Methyl-β-cyclodextrin added apically to MPKCCD14 cells resulted in a slow decline in amiloride-sensitive sodium transport with short circuit current reductions of 38.1 ± 9.6\% after 60 min. The slow decline in ENaC activity in response to apical cyclodextrin was identical to the rate of decline seen when protein synthesis was inhibited by cycloheximide. Apical biotinylation of MPKCCD14 cells confirmed the loss of ENaC at the cell surface following cyclodextrin treatment. Acute stimulation of the recycling pool of ENaC was unaffected by apical cyclodextrin application. Expression of dominant negative caveolin isoforms (CAV1-eGFP and CAV3-DGV) which disrupt caveolae, reduced basal ENaC currents by 72.3 and 78.2\%, respectively; but, as with cyclodextrin, the acute response to forskolin was unaffected. We conclude that ENaC is present in and regulated by lipid rafts. The data are consistent with a model in which rafts mediate the constitutive apical delivery of ENaC.}

  abstract = {Summary Ubiquitination of the EGF receptor (EGFR) is believed to play a critical role in regulating both its localization and its stability. To elucidate the role of EGFR ubiquitination, tandem mass spectrometry was used to identify six distinct lysine residues within the kinase domain of the EGFR, which can be conjugated to ubiquitin following growth factor stimulation. Substitution of these lysine residues with arginines resulted in a dramatic decrease in overall ubiquitination but preserved normal tyrosine phosphorylation of EGFR. Ubiquitination-deficient EGFR mutants displayed a severe defect in their turnover rates but were internalized at rates comparable to those of wild-type receptors. Finally, quantitative mass spectrometry demonstrated that more than 50\% of all EGFR bound ubiquitin was in the form of polyubiquitin chains, primarily linked through Lys63. Taken together, these data provide direct evidence for the role of EGFR ubiquitination in receptor targeting to the lysosome and implicate Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in this sorting process.},

  abstract = {The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is a tetramer of two α-, one β-, and one γ-subunit, but little is known about its assembly and processing. Because co-expression of mouse ENaC subunits with three different carboxyl-terminal epitope tags produced an amiloride-sensitive sodium current in oocytes, these tagged subunits were expressed in both Chinese hamster ovary or Madin-Darby canine kidney type 1 epithelial cells for further study. When expressed alone α-(95 kDa), β-(96 kDa), and γ-subunits (93 kDa) each produced a single band on SDS gels by immunoblotting. However, co-expression of αβγENaC subunits revealed a second band for each subunit (65 kDa for α, 110 kDa for β, and 75 kDa for γ) that exhibited N-glycans that had been processed to complex type based on sensitivity to treatment with neuraminidase, resistance to cleavage by endoglycosidase H, and GalNAc-independent labeling with [3H]Gal in glycosylation-defective Chinese hamster ovary cells (ldlD). The smaller size of the processed α- and γ-subunits is also consistent with proteolytic cleavage. By using α- and γ-subunits with epitope tags at both the amino and carboxyl termini, proteolytic processing of the α- and γ-subunits was confirmed by isolation of an additional epitope-tagged fragment from the amino terminus (30 kDa for α and 18 kDa for γ) consistent with cleavage within the extracellular loop. The fragments remain stably associated with the channel as shown by immunoblotting of co-immunoprecipitates, suggesting that proteolytic cleavage represents maturation rather than degradation of the channel.}

In vitro, assembly and expression of functional active sodium channels in the Xenopus oocyte is strictly dependent on αENaC — the β and γ sub-units by themselves are unable to induce an amiloride-sensitive sodium current in this heterologous expression system2. In vivo, ENaC constitutes the limiting step for sodium absorption in epithelial cells that line the distal renal tubule, distal colon and the duct of several exocrine glands. The adult lung expresses α, β and γ ENaC3,4, and an amiloride-sensitive electrogenic sodium reabsorption has been documented in upper and lower airways3–7, but it is not established whether this sodium transport is mediated by ENaC in vivo. We inactivated the mouse αENaC gene by gene targeting. Amiloride-sensitive electrogenic Na+ transport was abolished in airway epithelia from αENaC(−/−) mice. αENaC(−/−) neonates developed respiratory distress and died within 40 h of birth from failure to clear their lungs of liquid. This study shows that ENaC plays a critical role in the adaptation of the newborn lung to air breathing.}

Nonetheless, finding inhibitors with good properties as therapeutic agents remains a challenge since the key determinants of binding affinity and specificity are still poorly understood. We present here a detailed structural and thermodynamic study of the interactions of hNEDD4-WW3 with viral Late domains combining isothermal titration calorimetry, NMR structural determination and molecular dynamics simulations. Structural and energetic differences in Late domain recognition reveal a highly plastic hNEDD4-WW3 binding site that can accommodate PPxY-containing ligands with varying orientations. These orientations are mostly determined by specific conformations adopted by residues I859 and T866. Our results suggest a conformational selection mechanism, extensive to other WW domains, and highlight the functional relevance of hNEDD4-WW3 domain conformational flexibility at the binding interface, which emerges as a key element to consider in the search for potent and selective inhibitors of therapeutic interest.}

Recently, Nedd4 and Nedd4?2 have been identified as ubiquitin ligases that can interact with ENaC via its PY motifs to regulate channel activity. To further understand the role of human Nedd4?2 (hNedd4?2), we cloned its cDNAs and determined its genomic organization using a bioinformatic approach. The gene is present as a single copy, spans at least 400 kb, and contains {$>$}40 exons. Multiple 5?-exons were identified by 5?-rapid amplification of cDNA ends, and tissue-specific expression of these transcripts was noted by RT-PCR and RNase protection assay. Alternate polyadenylation signal sequences led to varying lengths of the 3?-untranslated region. Alternate splicing events within internal exons were also noted. Open reading frame analysis indicates that hNedd4?2 encode multiple protein variants with and without a C2 domain, and with a variable number of WW domains. Coexpression, in Fischer rat thyroid epithelia, of ENaC and Nedd4?2 cDNAs leads to a significant reduction in amiloride-sensitive currents, confirming a role in Na+ transport regulation. In vitro binding studies demonstrated that individual PY motifs of α-, ?-, and ?-ENaC have strong affinity for WW domains 3 and 4 but not 1 and 2. These studies indicate that alternate transcripts of Nedd4?2 may interact with ENaC differently. Understanding the function of variant proteins will increase our knowledge of the role of hNedd4?2 in the regulation of ENaC and define protein domains important for Nedd4?2 function.}

We recently reported that human Nedd4?2 (hNedd4?2) is expressed as many isoforms because of alternative promoter usage and/or variable splicing. To understand the relevance of hNedd4?2 isoforms for collecting duct Na+ transport, we studied the interaction with ENaC and the intracellular localization and function of the following three naturally occurring hNedd4?2 isoforms: full-length Nedd4?2 (Nedd4?2), Nedd4?2 lacking the NH2-terminal C2 domain (Nedd4?2?C2), and Nedd4?2 lacking the C2 domain and WW domains 2 and 3 (Nedd4?2?WW2,3). Nedd4?2 and Nedd4?2?C2 associate with ENaC and robustly reduce Na+ transport in Xenopus oocytes, whereas the interaction with and functional effect of Nedd4?2?WW2,3 on ENaC is weak. Nedd4?2 is expressed in the mouse collecting duct, and overexpression of Nedd4?2 reduces endogenous ENaC activity in a collecting duct cell line. This reduction in ENaC activity can be reversed early with exposure to dexamethasone, an effect that is associated with an increase in sgk1 abundance. The C2 domain is required to target Nedd4?2 to the plasma membrane in response to elevation of intracellular Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in MDCK cells, although it does not appear to mediate the inhibitory effect of [Ca2+]i on Na+ transport. Our data illustrate that naturally occurring hNedd4?2 isoforms differentially associate with ENaC to regulate its activity.},

CFTR is expressed in airway epithelia, but how CF alters electrolyte transport across airway epithelia has remained uncertain. Recent studies of a porcine model showed that in vivo, excised, and cultured CFTR−/− and CFTRΔF508/ΔF508 airway epithelia lacked anion conductance, and they did not hyperabsorb Na+. Therefore, we asked whether Cl− and Na+ conductances were altered in human CF airway epithelia. We studied differentiated primary cultures of tracheal/bronchial epithelia and found that transepithelial conductance (Gt) under basal conditions and the cAMP-stimulated increase in Gt were markedly attenuated in CF epithelia compared with non-CF epithelia. These data reflect loss of the CFTR anion conductance. In CF and non-CF epithelia, the Na+ channel inhibitor amiloride produced similar reductions in Gt and Na+ absorption, indicating that Na+ conductance in CF epithelia did not exceed that in non-CF epithelia. Consistent with previous reports, adding amiloride caused greater reductions in transepithelial voltage and short-circuit current in CF epithelia than in non-CF epithelia; these changes are attributed to loss of a Cl− conductance. These results indicate that Na+ conductance was not increased in these cultured CF tracheal/bronchial epithelia and point to loss of anion transport as key to airway epithelial dysfunction in CF.}

Electrophysiological studies on aspartate-to-asparagine mutants confirm that these carboxyl-carboxylate pairs participate in proton sensing. Between the acidic residues and the transmembrane pore lies a disulphide-rich ‘thumb’ domain poised to couple the binding of protons to the opening of the ion channel, thus demonstrating that proton activation involves long-range conformational changes.}

Heavy atom clusters may be introduced in a general way by the construction of “adaptor” molecules based on single-chain Fv antibody fragments, consisting of a constant framework region engineered for optimal cluster binding and a variable antigen binding region selected for a specific target. The success of the method depends on the mobility of the heavy atom cluster on the particle, on the precision to which clusters can be located in an image, and on the sufficiency of cluster projections alone to orient and select particles for averaging.

Although mechanosensitive ion channels are thought to initiate VSMC stretch-induced contraction, their molecular identity is unknown. Recent reports suggest degenerin/epithelial Na+ channels (DEG/ENaC) may form mechanotransducers in sensory neurons and VSMCs; however, the role of DEG/ENaC proteins in myogenic constriction of mouse renal arteries has not been established. To test the hypothesis that DEG/ENaC proteins are required for myogenic constriction in renal vessels, we first determined expression of ENaC transcripts and proteins in mouse renal VSMCs. Then, we determined pressure- and agonist-induced constriction and changes in vascular smooth muscle cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ in isolated mouse renal interlobar arteries following DEG/ENaC inhibition with amiloride and benzamil. We detect α-, ?-, and ?ENaC transcript and protein expression in cultured mouse renal VSMC. In contrast, we detect only ?- and ?- but not αENaC protein in freshly dispersed mrVMSC. Selective DEG/ENaC inhibition, with low doses of amiloride and benzamil, abolishes pressure-induced constriction and increases in cytosolic Ca2+ and Na+ without diminishing agonist-induced responses in isolated mouse interlobar arteries. Our findings indicate that DEG/ENaC proteins are required for myogenic constriction in mouse interlobar arteries and are consistent with our hypothesis that DEG/ENaC proteins may be components of mechanosensitive ion channel complexes required for myogenic vasoconstriction.}

Here, we explored the molecular mechanisms of these NEDD4-1 and WWP2 regulatory regions and their interplay with allosteric binding proteins such as Nedd4 family interacting protein (NDFIP1), engineered ubiquitin variants, and linker phosphomimics. We found that in addition to influencing catalytic activities, the WW domain linker regions in NEDD4-1 and WWP2 can impact product distribution, including the degree of polyubiquitination and Lys-48 versus Lys-63 linkages. We show that allosteric activation by NDFIP1 or engineered ubiquitin variants is largely mediated by relief of WW domain linker autoinhibition. WWP2-mediated ubiquitination of WW domain-binding protein 2 (WBP2), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and p62 proteins by WWP2 suggests that substrate ubiquitination can also be influenced by WW linker autoinhibition, although to differing extents. Overall, our results provide a deeper understanding of the intricate and multifaceted set of regulatory mechanisms in the control of NEDD4-1 related ubiquitin ligases.}

  abstract = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50~years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far~short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.}

  abstract = {ASICs (acid-sensing ion channels) are H+-gated Na+ channels with a widespread expression pattern in the central and the peripheral nervous system. ASICs have a simple topology with two transmembrane domains, cytoplasmic termini and a large ectodomain between the transmembrane domains; this topology has been confirmed by the crystal structure of chicken ASIC1. ASIC1a and ASIC1b are two variants encoded by the asic1 gene. The variable part of the protein includes the cytoplasmic N-terminus, the first transmembrane domain and approximately the first third of the ectodomain. Both variants contain two consensus sequences for N-linked glycosylation in the common, distal part of the ectodomain. In contrast with ASIC1a, ASIC1b contains two additional consensus sequences in the variable, proximal part of the ectodomain. Here we show that all the extracellular asparagine residues within the putative consensus sequences for N-glycosylation carry glycans. The two common distal glycans increase surface expression of the channels, but are no absolute requirement for channel activity. In sharp contrast, the presence of at least one of the two proximal glycans, which are specific to ASIC1b, is an absolute requirement for surface expression of ASIC1b. This result suggests substantial differences in the structure of the proximal ectodomain between the two ASIC1 variants.}

These mutations alter or delete PY motifs involved in protein?protein interactions with a ubiquitin-protein ligase, Nedd4. Here we show that Na+ transporting cells, derived from mouse cortical collecting duct, express two Nedd4 proteins with different structural organization and characteristics of ENaC regulation: 1) the classical Nedd4 (herein referred to as Nedd4?1) containing one amino-terminal C2, three WW, and one HECT-ubiquitin protein ligase domain and 2) a novel Nedd4 protein (Nedd4?2), homologous to Xenopus Nedd4 and comprising four WW, one HECT, yet lacking a C2 domain. Nedd4?2, but not Nedd4?1, inhibits ENaC activity when coexpressed in Xenopus oocytes and this property correlates with the ability to bind to ENaC, as only Nedd4?2 coimmunoprecipitates with ENaC. Furthermore, this interaction depends on the presence of at least one PY motif in the ENaC complex and on WW domains 3 and 4 in Nedd4?2. Thus, these results suggest that the novel suppressor protein Nedd4?2 is the regulator of ENaC and hence a potential susceptibility gene for arterial hypertension.?Kamynina, E., Debonneville, C., Bens, M., Vandewalle, A., Staub, O.

Here we present evidence that TAB2 and TAB3 are receptors that bind preferentially to lysine 63-linked polyubiquitin chains through a highly conserved zinc finger (ZnF) domain. Mutations of the ZnF domain abolish the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to bind polyubiquitin chains, as well as their ability to activate TAK1 and IKK. Significantly, replacement of the ZnF domain with a heterologous ubiquitin binding domain restored the ability of TAB2 and TAB3 to activate TAK1 and IKK.

Nedd4 was demonstrated to bind the epithelial sodium channel (αβγENaC), by association of its WW domains with PY motifs (XPPXY) present in each ENaC subunit, and to regulate the cell surface stability of the channel. The PY motif of βENaC is deleted or mutated in Liddle syndrome, a hereditary form of hypertension caused by elevated ENaC activity. Here we report the solution structure of the third WW domain of Nedd4 complexed to the PY motif-containing region of βENaC (TLPIPGTPPPNYDSL, referred to as βP2). A polyproline type II helical conformation is adopted by the PPPN sequence. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal sequence YDSL forms a helical turn and both the tyrosine and the C-terminal leucine contact the WW domain. This is unlike other proline-rich peptides complexed to WW domains, which bind in an extended conformation and lack molecular interactions with residues C-terminal to the tyrosine or the structurally equivalent residue in non-PY motif WW domain targets. The Nedd4 WW domain–ENaC βP2 peptide structure expands our understanding of the mechanisms involved in WW domain–ligand recognition and the molecular basis of Liddle syndrome.}

Six, 13, and 5 consensus sites (Asn-X-Ser/Thr) for N-glycosylation reside in the extracellular domains of the mouse α-, β-, and γ-subunits, respectively. Because the importance of ENaC N-linked glycans has not been fully addressed, we examined the effect of preventing N-glycosylation of specific subunits on channel function, expression, maturation, and folding. Heterologous expression in Xenopus oocytes or Fischer rat thyroid cells with αβγ-ENaC lacking N-linked glycans on a single subunit reduced ENaC activity as well as the inhibitory response to extracellular Na(+). The lack of N-linked glycans on the β-subunit also precluded channel activation by trypsin. However, channel activation by shear stress was N-linked glycan independent, regardless of which subunit was modified. We also discovered that the lack of N-linked glycans on any one subunit reduced the total and surface levels of cognate subunits. The lack of N-linked glycans on the β-subunit had the largest effect on total levels, with the lack of N-linked glycans on the γ- and α-subunits having intermediate and modest effects, respectively. Finally, channels with wild-type β-subunits were more sensitive to limited trypsin proteolysis than channels lacking N-linked glycans on the β-subunit. Our results indicate that N-linked glycans on each subunit are required for proper folding, maturation, surface expression, and function of the channel.},

Nevertheless, one can increase the probability of successful crystallization by precrystallization screening, a process by which one analyzes the monodispersity and stability of the protein-detergent complex. Traditionally, this has required microgram to milligram quantities of purified protein and a concomitant investment of time and resources. Here, we describe a rapid and efficient precrystallization screening strategy in which the target protein is covalently fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) and the resulting unpurified protein is analyzed by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC). This strategy requires only nanogram quantities of unpurified protein and allows one to evaluate localization and expression level, the degree of monodispersity, and the approximate molecular mass. We show the application of this precrystallization screening to four membrane proteins derived from prokaryotic or eukaryotic organisms.}

These channels are activated by a variety of stimuli such as ligands (ASICs) and mechanical forces (degenerins), or otherwise are constitutively active (ENaC). Despite their functional heterogeneity, these channels might share common basic mechanisms for gating. Mutations of a conserved residue in the extracellular loop, namely the ?degenerin site? activate all members of the ENaC/degenerin family. Chemical modification of a cysteine introduced in the degenerin site of rat ENaC (?S518C) by the sulfhydryl reagents MTSET or MTSEA, results in a ?3-fold increase in the open probability. This effect is due to an 8-fold shortening of channel closed times and an increase in the number of long openings. In contrast to the intracellular gating domain in the N-terminus which is critical for channel opening, the intact extracellular degenerin site is necessary for normal channel closing, as illustrated by our observation that modification of ?S518C destabilises the channel closed state. The modification by the sulfhydryl reagents is state- and size-dependent consistent with a conformational change of the degenerin site during channel opening and closing. We propose that the intracellular and extracellular modulatory sites act on a common channel gate and control the activity of ENaC at the cell surface.}

The role of ENaC in Na+ homeostasis and in the control of blood pressure has been demonstrated recently by the identification of mutations in ENaC ? and ? subunits causing hypertension. The function of ENaC in Na+ reabsorption depends critically on its ability to discriminate between Na+ and other ions like K+ or Ca2+. ENaC is virtually impermeant to K+ ions, and the molecular basis for its high ionic selectivity is largely unknown. We have identified a conserved Ser residue in the second transmembrane domain of the ENaC α subunit (αS589), which when mutated allows larger ions such as K+, Rb+, Cs+, and divalent cations to pass through the channel. The relative ion permeability of each of the αS589 mutants is related inversely to the ionic radius of the permeant ion, indicating that αS589 mutations increase the molecular cutoff of the channel by modifying the pore geometry at the selectivity filter. Proper geometry of the pore is required to tightly accommodate Na+ and Li+ ions and to exclude larger cations. We provide evidence that ENaC discriminates between cations mainly on the basis of their size and the energy of dehydration.}

The concentration of half-maximal unitary conductance is 38 mM for Na+ and 118 mM for Li+, a kinetic property that can account for the differences in Li+ and Na+ permeability. We show here that mutation of amino acid residues at homologous positions in the pre-M2 segment of α, β, and γ subunits (αG587, βG529, γS541) decreases the Li+/Na+ selectivity by changing the apparent channel affinity for Li+ and Na+. Fitting single-channel data of the Li+ permeation to a discrete-state model including three barriers and two binding sites revealed that these mutations increased the energy needed for the translocation of Li+ from an outer ion binding site through the selectivity filter. Mutation of βG529 to Ser, Cys, or Asp made ENaC partially permeable to K+ and larger ions, similar to the previously reported αS589 mutations. We conclude that the residues αG587 to αS589 and homologous residues in the β and γ subunits form the selectivity filter, which tightly accommodates Na+ and Li+ ions and excludes larger ions like K+.}

  abstract = {The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), located in the apical membrane of tight epithelia, allows vectorial Na+ absorption. The amiloride-sensitive ENaC is highly selective for Na+ and Li+ ions. There is growing evidence that the short stretch of amino acid residues (preM2) preceding the putative second transmembrane domain M2 forms the outer channel pore with the amiloride binding site and the narrow ion-selective region of the pore. We have shown previously that mutations of the αS589 residue in the preM2 segment change the ion selectivity, making the channel permeant to K+ ions. To understand the molecular basis of this important change in ionic selectivity, we have substituted αS589 with amino acids of different sizes and physicochemical properties. Here, we show that the molecular cutoff of the channel pore for inorganic and organic cations increases with the size of the amino acid residue at position α589, indicating that αS589 mutations enlarge the pore at the selectivity filter. Mutants with an increased permeability to large cations show a decrease in the ENaC unitary conductance of small cations such as Na+ and Li+. These findings demonstrate the critical role of the pore size at the αS589 residue for the selectivity properties of ENaC. Our data are consistent with the main chain carbonyl oxygens of the αS589 residues lining the channel pore at the selectivity filter with their side chain pointing away from the pore lumen. We propose that the αS589 side chain is oriented toward the subunit–subunit interface and that substitution of αS589 by larger residues increases the pore diameter by adding extra volume at the subunit–subunit interface.}

These mutations lead to increased channel activity. In this study we show that wild-type ENaC is downregulated by intracellular Na+, and that Liddle mutants decrease the channel sensitivity to inhibition by intracellular Na+. This event results at high intracellular Na+ activity in 1.2-2.4-fold higher cell surface expression, and 2.8-3.5-fold higher average current per channel in Liddle mutants compared with the wild type. In addition, we show that a rapid increase in the intracellular Na+ activity induced downregulation of the activity of wild-type ENaC, but not Liddle mutants, on a time scale of minutes, which was directly correlated to the magnitude of the Na+ influx into the oocytes. Feedback inhibition of ENaC by intracellular Na+ likely represents an important cellular mechanism for controlling Na+ reabsorption in the distal nephron that has important implications for the pathogenesis of hypertension.}

Here we present Namdinator, an easy-to-use tool that enables the user to run a Molecular Dynamics Flexible Fitting (MDFF) simulation in an automated manner through a pipeline system. Namdinator will modify an atomic model to fit within cryo-EM or crystallography density maps, and can be used advantageously for both the initial fitting of models, and for a geometrical optimization step to correct outliers, clashes and other model problems. We have benchmarked Namdinator against 39 deposited models and maps from cryo-EM and observe model improvements in 34 of these cases (87\%). Clashes between atoms were reduced, and model-to-map fit and overall model geometry were improved, in several cases substantially. We show that Namdinator is able to model large scale conformational changes compared to the starting model. Namdinator is a fast and easy way to create suitable initial models for both cryo-EM and crystallography. It can fix model errors in the final steps of model building, and is usable for structural model builders at all skill levels. Namdinator is available as a web service (https://namdinator.au.dk), or can be run locally as a command-line tool.}

We have previously demonstrated that SPLUNC1 binds to and inhibits ENaC to maintain fluid homeostasis in airway epithelia and that this process fails in CF airways. Despite this, how SPLUNC1 actually regulates ENaC is unknown. Here, we found that SPLUNC1 caused α?-ENaC to internalize, whereas SPLUNC1 and ?-ENaC remained at the plasma membrane. Additional studies revealed that SPLUNC1 increased neural precursor cell?expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4-2?dependent ubiquitination of α- but not ?- or ?-ENaC. We also labeled intracellular ENaC termini with green fluorescent protein and mCherry, and found that extracellular SPLUNC1 altered intracellular ENaC Forster resonance energy transfer. Taken together, our data indicate that SPLUNC1 is an allosteric regulator of ENaC that dissociates α??-ENaC to generate a new SPLUNC1??-ENaC complex. These data indicate a novel mode for regulating ENaC at the plasma membrane.?Kim, C. S., Ahmad, S., Wu, T., Walton, W. G., Redinbo, M. R., Tarran, R.

ENaCs are activated by specific proteases in the biosynthetic pathway and at the cell surface and remove embedded inhibitory tracts, which allows channels to transition to higher open-probability states. Resolved structures of ENaC and an acid-sensing ion channel revealed highly organized extracellular regions. Within the periphery of ENaC subunits are unique domains formed by antiparallel ?-strands containing the inhibitory tracts and protease cleavage sites. ENaCs are inhibited by Na+ binding to specific extracellular site(s), which promotes channel transition to a lower open-probability state. Specific inositol phospholipids and channel modification by Cys-palmitoylation enhance channel open probability. How these regulatory factors interact in a concerted manner to influence channel open probability is an important question that has not been resolved. These various factors are reviewed, and the impact of specific factors on human disorders is discussed.}

  abstract = {Mechanosensitive ion channels are crucial for normal cell function and facilitate physiological function, such as blood pressure regulation. So far little is known about the molecular mechanisms of how channels sense mechanical force. Canonical vertebrate epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) formed by α-, ?-, and ?-subunits is a shear force (SF) sensor and a member of the ENaC/degenerin protein family. ENaC activity in epithelial cells contributes to electrolyte/fluid-homeostasis and blood pressure regulation. Furthermore, ENaC in endothelial cells mediates vascular responsiveness to regulate blood pressure. Here, we provide evidence that ENaC?s ability to mediate SF responsiveness relies on the ?force-from-filament? principle involving extracellular tethers and the extracellular matrix (ECM). Two glycosylated asparagines, respectively their N-glycans localized in the palm and knuckle domains of αENaC, were identified as potential tethers. Decreased SF-induced ENaC currents were observed following removal of the ECM/glycocalyx, replacement of these glycosylated asparagines, or removal of N-glycans. Endothelial-specific overexpression of αENaC in mice induced hypertension. In contrast, expression of αENaC lacking these glycosylated asparagines blunted this effect. In summary, glycosylated asparagines in the palm and knuckle domains of αENaC are important for SF sensing. In accordance with the force-from-filament principle, they may provide a connection to the ECM that facilitates vascular responsiveness contributing to blood pressure regulation.}

These channels were the first characterized effectors of the βγ subunits of G proteins. Because we currently lack structures of complexes between G proteins and Kir3 channels, their interactions leading to modulation of channel function are not well understood. The recent crystal structure of a chimera between the cytosolic domain of a mammalian Kir3.1 and the transmembrane region of a prokaryotic KirBac1.3 (Kir3.1 chimera) has provided invaluable structural insight. However, it was not known whether this chimera could form functional K+ channels. Here, we achieved the functional reconstitution of purified Kir3.1 chimera in planar lipid bilayers. The chimera behaved like a bona fide Kir channel displaying an absolute requirement for PIP2 and Mg2+-dependent inward rectification. The channel could also be blocked by external tertiapin Q. The three-dimensional reconstruction of the chimera by single particle electron microscopy revealed a structure consistent with the crystal structure. Channel activity could be stimulated by ethanol and activated G proteins. Remarkably, the presence of both activated Gα and Gβγ subunits was required for gating of the channel. These results confirm the Kir3.1 chimera as a valid structural and functional model of Kir3 channels.},

Here, we report that Nedd4 ubiquitin E3 ligase and b-arrestins regulate ubiquitination of mGlu7 in heterologous cells and rat neurons. Upon agonist stimulation, b-arrestins recruit Nedd4 to mGlu7 and facilitate Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of mGlu7. Nedd4 and b-arrestins regulate constitutive and agonist-induced endocytosis of mGlu7 and are required for mGlu7-dependent MAPK signaling in neurons. In addition, Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination results in the degradation of mGlu7 by both the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the lysosomal degradation pathway.

Here we exploit advances in electron cryo-microscopy to determine the structure of a mammalian TRP channel, TRPV1, at 3.4\,Å resolution, breaking the side-chain resolution barrier for membrane proteins without crystallization. Like voltage-gated channels, TRPV1 exhibits four-fold symmetry around a central ion pathway formed by transmembrane segments 5–6 (S5–S6) and the intervening pore loop, which is flanked by S1–S4 voltage-sensor-like domains. TRPV1 has a wide extracellular ‘mouth’ with a short selectivity filter. The conserved ‘TRP domain’ interacts with the S4–S5 linker, consistent with its contribution to allosteric modulation. Subunit organization is facilitated by interactions among cytoplasmic domains, including amino-terminal ankyrin repeats. These observations provide a structural blueprint for understanding unique aspects of TRP channel function.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Quantification of the disease burden caused by different risks informs prevention by providing an account of health loss different to that provided by a disease-by-disease analysis. No complete revision of global disease burden caused by risk factors has been done since a comparative risk assessment in 2000, and no previous analysis has assessed changes in burden attributable to risk factors over time. METHODS: We estimated deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs; sum of years lived with disability [YLD] and years of life lost [YLL]) attributable to the independent effects of 67 risk factors and clusters of risk factors for 21 regions in 1990 and 2010. We estimated exposure distributions for each year, region, sex, and age group, and relative risks per unit of exposure by systematically reviewing and synthesising published and unpublished data. We used these estimates, together with estimates of cause-specific deaths and DALYs from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010, to calculate the burden attributable to each risk factor exposure compared with the theoretical-minimum-risk exposure. We incorporated uncertainty in disease burden, relative risks, and exposures into our estimates of attributable burden. FINDINGS: In 2010, the three leading risk factors for global disease burden were high blood pressure (7·0\% [95\% uncertainty interval 6·2-7·7] of global DALYs), tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·3\% [5·5-7·0]), and alcohol use (5·5\% [5·0-5·9]). In 1990, the leading risks were childhood underweight (7·9\% [6·8-9·4]), household air pollution from solid fuels (HAP; 7·0\% [5·6-8·3]), and tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke (6·1\% [5·4-6·8]). Dietary risk factors and physical inactivity collectively accounted for 10·0\% (95\% UI 9·2-10·8) of global DALYs in 2010, with the most prominent dietary risks being diets low in fruits and those high in sodium. Several risks that primarily affect childhood communicable diseases, including unimproved water and sanitation and childhood micronutrient deficiencies, fell in rank between 1990 and 2010, with unimproved water and sanitation accounting for 0·9\% (0·4-1·6) of global DALYs in 2010. However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa childhood underweight, HAP, and non-exclusive and discontinued breastfeeding were the leading risks in 2010, while HAP was the leading risk in south Asia. The leading risk factor in Eastern Europe, most of Latin America, and southern sub-Saharan Africa in 2010 was alcohol use; in most of Asia, North Africa and Middle East, and central Europe it was high blood pressure. Despite declines, tobacco smoking including second-hand smoke remained the leading risk in high-income north America and western Europe. High body-mass index has increased globally and it is the leading risk in Australasia and southern Latin America, and also ranks high in other high-income regions, North Africa and Middle East, and Oceania. INTERPRETATION: Worldwide, the contribution of different risk factors to disease burden has changed substantially, with a shift away from risks for communicable diseases in children towards those for non-communicable diseases in adults. These changes are related to the ageing population, decreased mortality among children younger than 5 years, changes in cause-of-death composition, and changes in risk factor exposures. New evidence has led to changes in the magnitude of key risks including unimproved water and sanitation, vitamin A and zinc deficiencies, and ambient particulate matter pollution. The extent to which the epidemiological shift has occurred and what the leading risks currently are varies greatly across regions. In much of sub-Saharan Africa, the leading risks are still those associated with poverty and those that affect children. FUNDING: Bill \& Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {Na+ "self-inhibition" in tight epithelia describes the reduction in apical Na+ permeability observed with increasing luminal Na+ concentration. Patch clamp was used to examine regulation of self-inhibition at the level of single Na+ channels. After cell-attached patches (pipette solution, 129 mM NaCl) were obtained on amphibian distal nephron cells (A6), the 129 mM NaCl (high Na+) apical bath outside of the patch was replaced with 3 mM NaCl (low Na+). Within minutes there was an increase in open channel probability (Po) and the appearance of one to five "new" channels in patch membranes. A similar increase occurred when apical Na+ entry was blocked by luminal amiloride (10 microM). A23187 (1 microM), a calcium ionophore, added after low Na+ exchange, abolished the rise in channel activity. Increased Po and new channels, induced by either luminal Na+ or amiloride, were also reversed by either 4B-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 0.1 microM) or 1-oleyl-2-acetyl glycerol (OAG; 10 microM) over 15-30 min. 4 alpha-Phorbol (0.1 microM), an inactive phorbol, did not reduce channel activity. D-Sphingosine (100 microM), a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, increased Po and new channels. Conclusions: 1) modulation of apical Na+ permeability by luminal Na+ does not require direct interaction of Na+ with the channel protein but, rather, appears to involve an intracellular regulatory pathway, 2) relieving self-inhibition alters both the number and kinetics of single Na+ channels, 3) the effect of low Na+ must be modulated via decreased apical Na+ entry and intracellular Na+, since amiloride yielded similar results, 4) changes in intracellular Na+ probably affect Na+ channel activity via cytosolic Ca2+, 5) the effects of decreasing luminal Na+ are reversed by PKC activators and mimicked by PKC inhibitors suggesting a possible role for PKC in Na+ self-inhibition.}

  abstract = {New electron microscopy (EM) methods are making it possible to view the structures of large proteins and nucleic acid complexes at atomic detail, but the methods are difficult to apply to molecules smaller than approximately 50 kDa, which is larger than the size of the average protein in the cell. The present work demonstrates that a protein much smaller than that limit can be successfully visualized when it is attached to a large protein scaffold designed to hold 12 copies of the attached protein in symmetric and rigidly defined orientations. The small protein chosen for attachment and visualization can be modified to bind to other diverse proteins, opening a new avenue for imaging cellular proteins by cryo-EM.Current single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) techniques can produce images of large protein assemblies and macromolecular complexes at atomic level detail without the need for crystal growth. However, proteins of smaller size, typical of those found throughout the cell, are not presently amenable to detailed structural elucidation by cryo-EM. Here we use protein design to create a modular, symmetrical scaffolding system to make protein molecules of typical size suitable for cryo-EM. Using a rigid continuous alpha helical linker, we connect a small 17-kDa protein (DARPin) to a protein subunit that was designed to self-assemble into a cage with cubic symmetry. We show that the resulting construct is amenable to structural analysis by single-particle cryo-EM, allowing us to identify and solve the structure of the attached small protein at near-atomic detail, ranging from 3.5- to 5-Å resolution. The result demonstrates that proteins considerably smaller than the theoretical limit of 50 kDa for cryo-EM can be visualized clearly when arrayed in a rigid fashion on a symmetric designed protein scaffold. Furthermore, because the amino acid sequence of a DARPin can be chosen to confer tight binding to various other protein or nucleic acid molecules, the system provides a future route for imaging diverse macromolecules, potentially broadening the application of cryo-EM to proteins of typical size in the cell.}

Forty-four tag-single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) genes were selected and genotyped, and nine BP measurements were obtained during the 3-day examination. In the single-marker analyses, we identified significant associations of SCNN1A marker rs13306613 with diastolic BP (DBP) and SCNN1B marker rs12447134 with systolic BP (SBP) under codominant model after Bonferroni’s correction (P=2.82 × 10−5 and 4.63 × 10−4, respectively). In addition, five SNPs in SCNN1G and four SNPs in SCNN1B achieved nominal significance for SBP, DBP or mean arterial pressure (MAP) under the additive model. For example, the minor C allele of rs5735 in SCNN1G gene was associated with decreased SBP, DBP and MAP (P=0.016, 5.41 × 10−3 and 4.36 × 10−3, respectively). Gene-based results showed significant associations of SCNN1G and SCNN1B with BP levels. This study suggested that ENaC genes have important roles in BP regulation in the Han Chinese population. Future studies are warranted to replicate these findings, and functional studies are needed to identify true causal variants in ENaC genes.}

Here, we explored the basis for ion selectivity by incorporating unnatural amino acids into the channel, engineering channel stoichiometry and performing free energy simulations. We observed no preference for sodium at the “GAS belt” in the central constriction. Instead, we identified a band of glutamate and aspartate side chains at the lower end of the pore that enables preferential sodium conduction.},

  abstract = {Summary In yeast, the main ubiquitin ligase responsible for the sorting of proteins to the lysosomal vacuole is Rsp5, a member of the Nedd4 family of ligases whose distinguishing features are a catalytic homologous to E6AP C terminus (HECT) domain and 3 central WW domains that bind PY motifs in target proteins. Many substrates do not bind Rsp5 directly and instead rely on PY-containing adaptor proteins that interact with Rsp5. Recent studies indicate that the activities of these adaptors are elevated when they undergo ubiquitination, yet the mechanism whereby ubiquitination activates the adaptors and how this process is regulated remain unclear. Here, we report on a mechanism that explains how ubiquitination stimulates adaptor function and how this process can be regulated by the Rsp5-associated deubiquitinase, Ubp2. Our overexpression experiments revealed that several adaptors compete for Rsp5 in~vivo. We found that the ability of the adaptors to compete effectively was enhanced by their ubiquitination and diminished by a block of their ubiquitination. Ubiquitination-dependent adaptor activation required a ubiquitin-binding surface within the Rsp5 catalytic HECT domain. Finally, like constitutively ubiquitinated adaptors, a Ubp2 deficiency increased both the adaptor activity and the ability to compete for Rsp5. Our data support a model whereby ubiquitinated Rsp5 adaptors are more active when “locked” onto Rsp5 via its N-lobe ubiquitin-binding surface and less active when they are “unlocked” by Ubp2-mediated deubiquitination.},

Under normal conditions, the activity of various Nedd4 E3s is controlled through an autoinhibitory interaction of the N-terminal C2 domain with the C-terminal catalytic HECT domain. Here, we report the structural and functional framework for this intramolecular interaction. Our nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data and biochemical analyses on Smurf2 and Nedd4 show that the C2 domain has the potential to regulate E3 activity by maintaining the HECT domain in a low-activity state where its ability for transthiolation and noncovalent Ub binding are impaired.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hypertension is the leading preventable cause of premature death worldwide. We examined global disparities of hypertension prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control in 2010 and compared secular changes from 2000 to 2010. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE from 1995 through 2014 and supplemented with manual searches of retrieved article references. We included 135 population-based studies of 968 419 adults from 90 countries. Sex- and age-specific hypertension prevalences from each country were applied to population data to calculate regional and global numbers of hypertensive adults. Proportions of awareness, treatment, and control from each country were applied to hypertensive populations to obtain regional and global estimates. RESULTS: In 2010, 31.1\% (95\% confidence interval, 30.0\%-32.2\%) of the world's adults had hypertension; 28.5\% (27.3\%-29.7\%) in high-income countries and 31.5\% (30.2\%-32.9\%) in low- and middle-income countries. An estimated 1.39 (1.34-1.44) billion people had hypertension in 2010: 349 (337-361) million in high-income countries and 1.04 (0.99-1.09) billion in low- and middle-income countries. From 2000 to 2010, the age-standardized prevalence of hypertension decreased by 2.6\% in high-income countries, but increased by 7.7\% in low- and middle-income countries. During the same period, the proportions of awareness (58.2\% versus 67.0\%), treatment (44.5\% versus 55.6\%), and control (17.9\% versus 28.4\%) increased substantially in high-income countries, whereas awareness (32.3\% versus 37.9\%) and treatment (24.9\% versus 29.0\%) increased less, and control (8.4\% versus 7.7\%) even slightly decreased in low- and middle-income countries. CONCLUSIONS: Global hypertension disparities are large and increasing. Collaborative efforts are urgently needed to combat the emerging hypertension burden in low- and middle-income countries.},

How two ATP synthase complexes dimerize to promote cristae formation is unknown. Here we resolved the structure of the dimeric F1F0 ATP synthase complex isolated from bovine heart mitochondria by transmission electron microscopy. The structure of the ATP synthase dimer has an overall conic appearance that is consistent with the proposed role of the dimeric enzyme in mitochondrial cristae biogenesis. The ATP synthase dimer interface is formed by contacts on both the F0 and F1 domains. A cross-bridging protein density was resolved which connects the two F0 domains on the intermembrane space side of the membrane. On the matrix side of the complex, the two F1 moieties are connected by a protein bridge, which is attributable to the IF1 inhibitor protein.},

As we reported previously, both human and rodent Nedd4L/Nedd4-2 showed molecular diversity, with and without a C2 domain in their N-terminal. Nedd4L/Nedd4-2 isoforms with a C2 domain are hypothesized to be related closely to ubiquitination of ENaCs. We generated Nedd4-2 C2 domain knockout mice. We demonstrate here that loss of Nedd4-2 C2 isoform causes salt-sensitive hypertension under conditions of a high dietary salt intake in vivo. The knockout mice had reduced urinary sodium excretion, osmotic pressure and increased water intake and urine volume with marked dilatation of cortical tubules while receiving a high salt diet. To the contrary, there was no difference in metabolic data between wild-type and knockout mice receiving a normal control diet. In the absence of Nedd4-2 C2 domain, a high salt intake accelerated ENaC expression. Coimmunoprecipitation studies revealed suppressed ubiquitination for ENaC with a high salt intake. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that during a high oral salt intake the Nedd4-2 C2 protein plays a pivotal role in maintaining adaptive salt handling in the kidney.}

  abstract = {Abstract The adaptor protein Grb10 is an interacting partner of the IGF-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR). Previous work from our laboratory has established the role of Grb10 as a negative regulator of IGF-IR-dependent cell proliferation. We have shown that Grb10 binds the E3 ubiquitin ligase Nedd4 and promotes IGF-I-stimulated ubiquitination, internalization, and degradation of the IGF-IR, thereby giving rise to long-term attenuation of signaling. Recent biochemical evidence suggests that tyrosine-kinase receptors (RTK) may not be polyubiquitinated but monoubiquitinated at multiple sites (multiubiquitinated). However, the type of ubiquitination of the IGF-IR is still not defined. Here we show that the Grb10/Nedd4 complex upon ligand stimulation mediates multiubiquitination of the IGF-IR, which is required for receptor internalization. Moreover, Nedd4 by promoting IGF-IR ubiquitination and internalization contributes with Grb10 to negatively regulate IGF-IR-dependent cell proliferation. We also demonstrate that the IGF-IR is internalized through clathrin-dependent and-independent pathways. Grb10 and Nedd4 remain associated with the IGF-IR in early endosomes and caveosomes, where they may participate in sorting internalized receptors. Grb10 and Nedd4, unlike the IGF-IR, which is targeted for lysosomal degradation are not degraded and likely directed into recycling endosomes. These results indicate that Grb10 and Nedd4 play a critical role in mediating IGF-IR down-regulation by promoting ligand-dependent multiubiquitination of the IGF-IR, which is required for receptor internalization and regulates mitogenesis.

Although ENaC activity is regulated by a number of factors, palmitoylation of its cytoplasmic Cys residues has not been previously described. Fatty acid-exchange chemistry was used to determine whether channel subunits were Cys-palmitoylated. We observed that only the β and γ subunits were modified by Cys palmitoylation. Analyses of ENaCs with mutant β subunits revealed that Cys-43 and Cys-557 were palmitoylated. Xenopus oocytes expressing ENaC with a β C43A,C557A mutant had significantly reduced amiloride-sensitive whole cell currents, enhanced Na+ self-inhibition, and reduced single channel Po when compared with wild-type ENaC, while membrane trafficking and levels of surface expression were unchanged. Computer modeling of cytoplasmic domains indicated that β Cys-43 is in proximity to the first transmembrane α helix, whereas β Cys-557 is within an amphipathic α-helix contiguous with the second transmembrane domain. We propose that β subunit palmitoylation modulates channel gating by facilitating interactions between cytoplasmic domains and the plasma membrane.}

  abstract = {Epithelial sodium channels (ENaC) are critically important in the regulation of ion and fluid balance in both renal and respiratory epithelia. ENaC functional polymorphisms may contribute to alterations in blood pressure in the general population. We previously reported that the A663T polymorphism in the C terminus of the α-subunit altered ENaC functional and surface expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Samaha FF, Rubenstein RC, Yan W, Ramkumar M, Levy DI, Ahn YJ, Sheng S, Kleyman TR. J Biol Chem 279: 23900?23907, 2004). We examined whether sites in the vicinity of 663 influenced channel activity by performing scanning Ala mutagenesis. Interestingly, only αT663/G667A?? channels exhibited increased currents compared with αT663??. This increase in channel activity reflected an increase in channel open probability and not an increase in channel surface expression. In contrast, decreases in channel activity were observed with both αT663/C664A?? and αT663/C664M?? channels. The decrease in functional expression of αT663/C664M?? channels correlated with decreased surface expression, suggesting that the αC664M mutation altered the intracellular trafficking of the channel. While cytoplasmic Cys residues may be modified by the addition of palmitate, we did not observe palmitoylation of αC664. Our results suggest that multiple residues in the distal part of the cytoplasmic C terminus have roles in modulating channel activity.}

Our previous work revealed that two cytoplasmic Cys residues in the β subunit, βCys-43 and βCys-557, are Cys-palmitoylated. ENaCs with mutant βC43A/C557A exhibit normal surface expression but enhanced Na+ self-inhibition and reduced channel open probability. Although the α subunit is not palmitoylated, we now show that the two cytoplasmic Cys residues in the γ subunit are palmitoylated. ENaCs with mutant γC33A, γC41A, or γC33A/C41A exhibit reduced activity compared with wild type channels but normal surface expression and normal levels of α and γ subunit-activating cleavage. These mutant channels have significantly enhanced Na+ self-inhibition and reduced open probability compared with wild type ENaCs. Channel activity was enhanced by co-expression with the palmitoyltransferase DHHC2 that also co-immunoprecipitates with ENaCs. Secondary structure prediction of the N terminus of the γ subunit places γCys-33 within an α-helix and γCys-44 on a coil before the first transmembrane domain within a short tract that includes a well conserved His-Gly motif, where mutations have been associated with altered channel gating. Our current and previous results suggest that palmitoylation of the β and γ subunits of ENaCs enhances interactions of their respective cytoplasmic domains with the plasma membrane and stabilizes the open state of the channel. Comparison of activities of channels lacking palmitoylation sites in individual or multiple subunits revealed that γ subunit palmitoylation has a dominant role over β subunit palmitoylation in modulating ENaC gating.},

Like mammalian Pacinian corpuscles, these neurons depolarized with both positive and negative changes in external force but not with sustained force. Null mutations in the DEG/ENaC gene mec-4 and in the accessory ion channel subunit genes mec-2 and mec-6 eliminated MRCs. In contrast, the genetic elimination of touch neuron–specific microtubules reduced, but did not abolish, MRCs.

Ion fluxes through the channel were measured as the transepithelial current inhibited by amiloride, a specific blocker of the channel's Na conductance. The selectivity sequence for alkali metal cations was H{$>$}Li{$>$}Na≫K. K, permeability was barely detectable; the selectivity for Na over K was about 1000:1.

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of an object mass density from the set of its 2D line projections lies at a core of both single-particle reconstruction technique and electron tomography. Both techniques utilize electron microscope to collect a set of projections of either multiple objects representing in principle the same macromolecular complex in an isolated form, or a subcellular structure isolated in situ. Therefore, the goal of macromolecular electron microscopy is to invert the projection transformation to recover the distribution of the mass density of the original object. The problem is interesting in that in its discrete form it is ill-posed and not invertible. Various algorithms have been proposed to cope with the practical difficulties of this inversion problem and their differ widely in terms of their robustness with respect to noise in the data, completeness of the collected projection dataset, errors in projections orientation parameters, abilities to efficiently handle large datasets, and other obstacles typically encountered in molecular electron microscopy. Here, we review the theoretical foundations of 3D reconstruction from line projections followed by an overview of reconstruction algorithms routinely used in practice of electron microscopy.},

  abstract = {Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps are now at the point where resolvability of individual atoms can be achieved. However, resolvability is not necessarily uniform throughout the map. We introduce a quantitative parameter to characterize the resolvability of individual atoms in cryo-EM maps, the map Q-score. Q-scores can be calculated for atoms in proteins, nucleic acids, water, ligands and other solvent atoms, using models fitted to or derived from cryo-EM maps. Q-scores can also be averaged to represent larger features such as entire residues and nucleotides. Averaged over entire models, Q-scores correlate very well with the estimated resolution of cryo-EM maps for both protein and RNA. Assuming the models they are calculated from are well fitted to the map, Q-scores can be used as a measure of resolvability in cryo-EM maps at various scales, from entire macromolecules down to individual atoms. Q-score analysis of multiple cryo-EM maps of the same proteins derived from different laboratories confirms the reproducibility of structural features from side chains down to water and ion atoms.}

  abstract = {Nedd4 is a ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) containing a C2 domain, three or four WW domains, and a ubiquitin ligase HECT domain. We have shown previously that the C2 domain of Nedd4 is responsible for its Ca2+-dependent targeting to the plasma membrane, particularly the apical region of epithelial MDCK cells. To investigate this apical preference, we searched for Nedd4-C2 domain-interacting proteins that might be involved in targeting Nedd4 to the apical surface. Using immobilized Nedd4-C2 domain to trap interacting proteins from MDCK cell lysate, we isolated, in the presence of Ca2+, a ∼35–40-kD protein that we identified as annexin XIII using mass spectrometry. Annexin XIII has two known isoforms, a and b, that are apically localized, although XIIIa is also found in the basolateral compartment. In vitro binding and coprecipitation experiments showed that the Nedd4-C2 domain interacts with both annexin XIIIa and b in the presence of Ca2+, and the interaction is direct and optimal at 1 μM Ca2+. Immunofluorescence and immunogold electron microscopy revealed colocalization of Nedd4 and annexin XIIIb in apical carriers and at the apical plasma membrane. Moreover, we show that Nedd4 associates with raft lipid microdomains in a Ca2+-dependent manner, as determined by detergent extraction and floatation assays. These results suggest that the apical membrane localization of Nedd4 is mediated by an association of its C2 domain with the apically targeted annexin XIIIb.}

We have recently demonstrated an association between the WW domains of Nedd4 and the proline-rich PY motifs (XPPXY) of the epithelial Na+ channel, as well as with PY motifs of several other proteins. The role of the putative C2 domain of Nedd4 has not been elucidated. Here we show that Nedd4, endogenously expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, was redistributed from the cytosolic to the particulate fraction in response to ionomycin plus Ca2+ treatment. A similar treatment of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells led to an apical and lateral membrane localization of Nedd4, as determined by immunostaining and confocal microscopy. The C2 domain of Nedd4, expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fusion protein, was sufficient to bind cellular membranes in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Moreover, this GST-Nedd4-C2 domain was able to mediate Ca2+-dependent interactions with phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylcholine liposomes in vitro. An epitope-tagged Nedd4 lacking its C2 domain and stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells failed to mediate the Ca2+-induced plasma membrane localization seen in wild-type (epitope-tagged) Nedd4. These results indicate that the putative C2 domain of Nedd4 acts as a bona fide C2 domain which binds phospholipids and membranes in a Ca2+-dependent fashion and is involved in localizing the protein primarily to the apical region of polarized epithelial cells in response to Ca2+.}

  abstract = {Purpose of review Epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) activity is limiting for sodium reabsorption in the distal nephron. Humans regulate blood pressure by fine-tuning sodium balance through control of ENaC. ENaC dysfunction causes some hypertensive and renal salt wasting diseases. Thus, it is critical to understand the cellular mechanisms controlling ENaC activity. Recent findings ENaC is sensitive to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), the target of phospholipase C-mediated metabolism, and phosphatidylinositiol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3), the product of phosphatidylinositide 3-OH kinase (PI3-K). PIP2 is permissive for ENaC gating possibly interacting directly with the channel. Activation of distal nephron P2Y receptors tempers ENaC activity by promoting PIP2 metabolism. This is important because gene deletion of P2Y2 receptors causes hypertension associated with hyperactive ENaC. Aldosterone, the final hormone in a negative-feedback cascade activated by decreases in blood pressure, increases ENaC activity. PIP3 sits at a critical bifurcation in the aldosterone-signaling cascade, increasing ENaC open probability and number. PIP3-effectors mediate increases in ENaC number by suppressing channel retrieval. PIP3 binds ENaC, at a site distinct from that important to PIP2 regulation, to modulate directly open probability. Summary Phosphoinositides play key roles in physiologic control of ENaC and perhaps dysregulation plays a role in disease associated with abnormal renal sodium handling.},

This regulation is physiologically relevant for its dysfunction, in some instances, causes disease. Recent studies identify the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) as a channel sensitive to phosphatidylinositides. ENaC appears capable of binding both PI(4,5)P2 and PI(3,4,5)P3 with binding stabilizing channel gating. The binding sites for these molecules within ENaC are likely to be distinct with the former phosphoinositide interacting with elements in the cytosolic NH2-terminus of the ?- and ?-ENaC subunits and the latter with cytosolic regions immediately following the second transmembrane domains in these two subunits. PI(4,5)P2 binding to ENaC appears saturated at rest and necessary for channel gating. Thus, decreases in cellular PI(4,5)P2 levels may serve as a convergence point for inhibitory regulation of ENaC by G-protein coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases. In contrast, apparent PI(3,4,5)P3 binding to ENaC is not saturated. This enables the channel to respond with gating changes in a rapid and dynamic manner to signalling input that influences cellular PI(3,4,5)P3 levels.}

  abstract = {Protein cage self-assembly enables encapsulation and sequestration of small molecules, macromolecules, and nanomaterials for many applications in bionanotechnology. Notably, wild-type thermophilic ferritin from Archaeoglobus fulgidus (AfFtn) exists as a stable dimer of four-helix bundle proteins at a low ionic strength, and the protein forms a hollow assembly of 24 protomers at a high ionic strength (∼800 mM NaCl). This assembly process can also be initiated by highly charged gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in solution, leading to encapsulation. These data suggest that salt solutions or charged AuNPs can shield unfavorable electrostatic interactions at AfFtn dimer–dimer interfaces, but specific “hot-spot” residues controlling assembly have not been identified. To investigate this further, we computationally designed three AfFtn mutants (E65R, D138K, and A127R) that introduce a single positive charge at sites along the dimer–dimer interface. These proteins exhibited different assembly kinetics and thermodynamics, which were ranked in order of increasing 24mer propensity: A127R {$<$} wild type {$<$} D138K ≪ E65R. E65R assembled into the 24mer across a wide range of ionic strengths (0–800 mM NaCl), and the dissociation temperature for the 24mer was 98 °C. X-ray crystal structure analysis of the E65R mutant identified a more compact, closed-pore cage geometry. A127R and D138K mutants exhibited wild-type ability to encapsulate and stabilize 5 nm AuNPs, whereas E65R did not encapsulate AuNPs at the same high yields. This work illustrates designed protein cages with distinct assembly and encapsulation properties.},

For example, membrane proteins are often kept in solution with detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs that are locally disordered. Such spatial variability negatively impacts computational three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction with existing iterative refinement algorithms that assume rigidity. We introduce non-uniform refinement, an algorithm based on cross-validation optimization, which automatically regularizes 3D density maps during refinement to account for spatial variability. Unlike common shift-invariant regularizers, non-uniform refinement systematically removes noise from disordered regions, while retaining signal useful for aligning particle images, yielding dramatically improved resolution and 3D map quality in many cases. We obtain high-resolution reconstructions for multiple membrane proteins as small as 100\,kDa, demonstrating increased effectiveness of cryo-EM for this class of targets critical in structural biology and drug discovery. Non-uniform refinement is implemented in the cryoSPARC software package.}

GluR1Lc channels also exhibit slowed kinetics and a shift in their apparent affinity for glutamate (Kohda et al., 2000; Taverna et al., 2000). Here, we have undertaken a kinetic analysis of GluR1Lc channels to quantify the effects of lurcher and to determine the relative contribution of these effects to the lurcher phenotype. Analysis of GluR1Lc leak current demonstrated that the 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX)-sensitive portion of the leak current corresponded to a current generated by glutamate concentrations similar to the levels of contaminating glutamate measured in our normal external solutions. This result, and the small size of the leak current relative to the currents evoked by saturating glutamate, indicates that GluR1Lc channels exhibit little or no constitutive activity. Our results indicate that the primary effect of the lurcher mutation is to increase the affinity of GluR1 for glutamate and reduce the desensitization of GluR1 at nanomolar concentrations. We also found that the mutation makes both the rate and extent of GluR1Lc channel desensitization depend strongly on subunit occupancy. We conclude that the poor survival of GluR1Lc-transfected cells, and presumably cerebellar neurons in lurcher mice, results because channels carrying the lurcher mutation open and do not desensitize at ambient levels of glutamate.}

In a larger-scale expression experiment (1.1 liter) a WT opsin production level of 6 mg/liter was obtained. Further, the toxic constitutively active rhodopsin mutant, E113Q/E134Q/M257Y, previously shown to require inducible expression, has now been expressed in an HEK293S GNTI?-inducible cell line at levels comparable with those obtained with WT rhodopsin.}

In this review, we discuss more specifically the activation of ENaC by serine proteases. Recent in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that membrane-bound serine proteases are of critical importance in the activation of ENaC in different organs, such as the kidney, the lung, or the cochlea. Progress in understanding the basic mechanism of proteolytic activation of ENaC is accelerating, but uncertainty about the most fundamental aspects persists, leaving numerous still-unanswered questions.}

  abstract = {Transcription and translation require a high concentration of potassium across the entire tree of life. The conservation of a high intracellular potassium was an absolute requirement for the evolution of life on Earth. This was achieved by the interplay of P- and V-ATPases that can set up electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane, an energetically costly process requiring the synthesis of ATP by F-ATPases. In animals, the control of an extracellular compartment was achieved by the emergence of multicellular organisms able to produce tight epithelial barriers creating a stable extracellular milieu. Finally, the adaptation to a terrestrian environment was achieved by the evolution of distinct regulatory pathways allowing salt and water conservation. In this review we emphasize the critical and dual role of Na+-K+-ATPase in the control of the ionic composition of the extracellular fluid and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in salt and water conservation in vertebrates. The action of aldosterone on transepithelial sodium transport by activation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) at the apical membrane and that of Na+-K+-ATPase at the basolateral membrane may have evolved in lungfish before the emergence of tetrapods. Finally, we discuss the implication of RAAS in the origin of the present pandemia of hypertension and its associated cardiovascular diseases.}

Named BioID for proximity-dependent biotin identification, this approach is based on fusion of a promiscuous Escherichia coli biotin protein ligase to a targeting protein. BioID features proximity-dependent biotinylation of proteins that are near-neighbors of the fusion protein. Biotinylated proteins may be isolated by affinity capture and identified by mass spectrometry. We apply BioID to lamin-A (LaA), a well-characterized intermediate filament protein that is a constituent of the nuclear lamina, an important structural element of the nuclear envelope (NE). We identify multiple proteins that associate with and/or are proximate to LaA in vivo. The most abundant of these include known interactors of LaA that are localized to the NE, as well as a new NE-associated protein named SLAP75. Our results suggest BioID is a useful and generally applicable method to screen for both interacting and neighboring proteins in their native cellular environment.}

Nedd4 Ub ligases share a common domain architecture and yet are regulated in distinct ways through interactions of the catalytic HECT domain with the N-terminal C2 domain or the central WW domain region. Smurf1 and Smurf2 are two highly related Nedd4 ligases with ∼70\% overall sequence identity. Here, we show that the Smurf1 C2 domain interacts with the HECT domain and inhibits ligase activity in trans. However, in contrast to Smurf2, we find that full-length Smurf1 is a highly active Ub ligase, and we can attribute this striking difference in regulation to the lack of one WW domain (WW1) in Smurf1. Using NMR spectroscopy and biochemical assays, we identified the WW1 region as an additional inhibitory element in Smurf2 that cooperates with the C2 domain to enhance HECT domain binding and Smurf2 inhibition. Our work provides important insights into Smurf regulation and highlights that the activities of highly related proteins can be controlled in distinct ways.},

ENaC is regulated by Nedd4-2–mediated ubiquitylation, which leads to its internalization; this process can be reversed by deubiquitylation, which is regulated by the aldosterone-induced enzyme Usp2-45. In a second regulatory pathway, ENaC can be activated by luminal serine protease–mediated cleavage of its extracellular loops. Whether these two regulatory processes interact, however, is unknown. Here, in HEK293 cells stably transfected with ENaC, Usp2-45 interacted with ENaC, leading to deubiquitylation of the channel and stimulation of ENaC activity {$>$}20-fold. This was accompanied by a modest increase in cell surface expression of ENaC and by proteolytic cleavage of αENaC and γENaC at their extracellular loops. When endocytosis was inhibited with dominant negative dynamin (DynK44R), channel density and γENaC cleavage were increased, but αENaC cleavage and ENaC activity were not augmented. When Usp2-45 was coexpressed with DynK44R, both αENaC cleavage and activity were recovered. In summary, these data suggest that Usp2-45 deubiquitylation of ENaC enhances the proteolytic activation of both αENaC and γENaC, possibly by inducing a conformational change and by interfering with endocytosis, respectively.}

To achieve this, we developed a shotgun-based lipidomics workflow that enabled the absolute quantification of mammalian membrane lipidomes with minimal sample processing from low sample amounts. Epithelial morphogenesis was accompanied by a major shift from sphingomyelin to glycosphingolipid, together with an increase in plasmalogen, phosphatidylethanolamine, and cholesterol content, whereas the opposite changes took place during an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition. Moreover, during polarization, the sphingolipids became longer, more saturated, and more hydroxylated as required to generate an apical membrane domain that serves as a protective barrier for the epithelial sheet.}

  abstract = {For three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of large macromolecular complexes, single-particle electron cryomicroscopy is considered the method of choice. Within this field, structure determination de novo, as opposed to refinement of known structures, still presents a major challenge, especially for macromolecules without point-group symmetry. This is primarily because of technical issues: one of these is poor image contrast, and another is the often low particle concentration and sample heterogeneity imposed by the practical limits of biochemical purification. In this work, we tested a state-of-the art 4k×4k charge-coupled device (CCD) detector (TVIPS TemCam-F415) to see whether or not it can contribute to improving the image features that are especially important for structure determination de novo. The present study is therefore focused on a comparison of film and CCD detector in the acquisition of images in the low-to-medium (∼10–25Å) resolution range using a 200kV electron microscope equipped with field emission gun. For comparison, biological specimens and radiation-insensitive carbon layers were imaged under various conditions to test the image phase transmission, spatial signal-to-noise ratio, visual image quality and power-spectral signal decay for the complete image-processing chain. At all settings of the camera, the phase transmission and spectral signal-to-noise ratio were significantly better on CCD than on film in the low-to-medium resolution range. Thus, the number of particle images needed for initial structure determination is reduced and the overall quality of the initial computed 3D models is improved. However, at high resolution, film is still significantly better than the CCD camera: without binning of the CCD camera and at a magnification of 70k×, film is better beyond 21Å resolution. With 4-fold binning of the CCD camera and at very high magnification ({$>$}300k×) film is still superior beyond 7Å resolution.},

Cryo-EM structures are typically filtered using ad hoc procedures to prevent overfitting, but the tuning of arbitrary parameters may lead to subjectivity in the results. I describe a Bayesian interpretation of cryo-EM structure determination, where smoothness in the reconstructed density is imposed through a Gaussian prior in the Fourier domain. The statistical framework dictates how data and prior knowledge should be combined, so that the optimal 3D linear filter is obtained without the need for arbitrariness and objective resolution estimates may be obtained. Application to experimental data indicates that the statistical approach yields more reliable structures than existing methods and is capable of detecting smaller classes in data sets that contain multiple different structures.},

The structures involved in the ion permeation pathway have only been partially identified, and the respective contributions of each subunit in the formation of the conduction pore has not yet been established. Using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we have identified in a short segment preceding the second membrane-spanning domain (the pre-M2 segment) amino acid residues involved in ion permeation and critical for channel block by amiloride. Cys substitutions of Gly residues in β and γ subunits at position βG525 and γG537 increased the apparent inhibitory constant (Ki) for amiloride by \&gt;1,000-fold and decreased channel unitary current without affecting ion selectivity. The corresponding mutation S583 to C in the α subunit increased amiloride Ki by 20-fold, without changing channel conducting properties. Coexpression of these mutated αβγ subunits resulted in a nonconducting channel expressed at the cell surface. Finally, these Cys substitutions increased channel affinity for block by externalZn2+ ions, in particular the αS583C mutant showing a Ki for Zn2+of 29 μM. Mutations of residues αW582L or βG522D also increased amiloride Ki, the later mutation generating a Ca2+blocking site located 15\% within the membrane electric field. These experiments provide strong evidence that αβγ ENaCs are pore-forming subunits involved in ion permeation through the channel. The pre-M2 segment of αβγ subunits may form a pore loop structure at the extracellular face of the channel, where amiloride binds within the channel lumen. We propose that amiloride interacts with Na+ions at an external Na+binding site preventing ion permeation through the channel pore.}

As a result, this family regulates a wide variety of cellular processes including transcription, stability and trafficking of plasma membrane proteins, and the degradation of misfolded proteins. The modular architecture of the proteins, comprising a C2 domain, multiple WW domains and a catalytic domain, enables diverse intermolecular interactions and recruitment to various subcellular locations. The WW domains commonly mediate interaction with substrate proteins; however, an increasing number of Nedd4 targets do not contain obvious WW domain-interaction motifs suggesting the involvement of accessory proteins. This review discusses recent insights into how accessory and adaptor proteins modulate the activities of Nedd4 family members, including recruitment of novel substrates, alteration of subcellular localisation and effects on ubiquitination.

  abstract = {Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) are inhibited by extracellular Na+, a process referred to as Na+ self-inhibition. We previously demonstrated that mutation of key residues within two furin cleavage consensus sites in α, or one site in ?, blocked subunit proteolysis and inhibited channel activity when mutant channels were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes (Hughey RP, Bruns JB, Kinlough CL, Harkleroad KL, Tong Q, Carattino MD, Johnson JP, Stockand JD, and Kleyman TR. J Biol Chem 279: 18111?18114, 2004). Cleavage of subunits was also blocked by these mutations when expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, and both subunit cleavage and channel activity were blocked when wild-type subunits were expressed in furin-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cells. We now report that channels with mutant α-subunits lacking either one or both furin cleavage sites exhibited a marked enhancement of the Na+ self-inhibition response, while channels with a mutant ?-subunit showed a modestly enhanced Na+ self-inhibition response. Analysis of Na+ self-inhibition at varying [Na+] indicates that channels containing mutant α-subunits exhibit an increased Na+ affinity. At the single-channel level, channels with a mutant α-subunit had a low open probability (Po) in the presence of a high external [Na+] in the patch pipette. Po dramatically increased when trypsin was also present, or when a low external [Na+] was in the patch pipette. Our results suggest that furin cleavage of ENaC subunits activates the channels by relieving Na+ self-inhibition and that activation requires that the α-subunit be cleaved twice. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time a clear relationship between ENaC Po and extracellular [Na+], supporting the notion that Na+ self-inhibition reflects a Po reduction due to high extracellular [Na+].}

  abstract = {Nedd4-2 has been proposed to play a critical role in regulating epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity. Biochemical and overexpression experiments suggest that Nedd4-2 binds to the PY motifs of ENaC subunits via its WW domains, ubiquitinates them, and decreases their expression on the apical membrane. Phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 (for example by Sgk1) may regulate its binding to ENaC, and thus ENaC ubiquitination. These results suggest that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC may play a crucial role in Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure (BP) regulation. To test these predictions in vivo, we generated Nedd4-2 null mice. The knockout mice had higher BP on a normal diet and a further increase in BP when on a high-salt diet. The hypertension was probably mediated by ENaC overactivity because 1) Nedd4-2 null mice had higher expression levels of all three ENaC subunits in kidney, but not of other Na+ transporters; 2) the downregulation of ENaC function in colon was impaired; and 3) NaCl-sensitive hypertension was substantially reduced in the presence of amiloride, a specific inhibitor of ENaC. Nedd4-2 null mice on a chronic high-salt diet showed cardiac hypertrophy and markedly depressed cardiac function. Overall, our results demonstrate that in vivo Nedd4-2 is a critical regulator of ENaC activity and BP. The absence of this gene is sufficient to produce salt-sensitive hypertension. This model provides an opportunity to further investigate mechanisms and consequences of this common disorder.}

Analysis of this gene reveals a premature stop codon that truncates the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the encoded protein in affected subjects.

The activity of ENaC is controlled by its interaction with Nedd4; mutations that disrupt this interaction increase Na+absorption, causing an inherited form of hypertension (Liddle's syndrome). Nedd4 contains an N-terminal C2 domain, a C-terminal ubiquitin ligase domain, and multiple WW domains. The C2 domain is thought to be involved in the Ca2+-dependent localization of Nedd4 at the cell surface. However, we found that the C2 domain was not required for human Nedd4 (hNedd4) to inhibit ENaC in both Xenopus oocytes and Fischer rat thyroid epithelia. Rather, hNedd4 lacking the C2 domain inhibited ENaC more potently than wild-type hNedd4. Earlier work indicated that the WW domains bind to PY motifs in the C terminus of ENaC. However, it is not known which WW domains mediate this interaction. GlutathioneS-transferase-fusion proteins of WW domains 2–4 each bound to α, β, and γENaC in vitro. The interactions were abolished by mutation of two residues. WW domain 3 (but not the other WW domains) was both necessary and sufficient for the binding of hNedd4 to αENaC. WW domain 3 was also required for the inhibition of ENaC by hNedd4; inhibition was nearly abolished when WW domain 3 was mutated. However, the interaction between ENaC and WW domain 3 alone was not sufficient for inhibition. Moreover, inhibition was decreased by mutation of WW domain 2 or WW domain 4. Thus, WW domains 2–4 each participate in the functional interaction between hNedd4 and ENaC in intact cells.}

ENaC is critical for Na+ homeostasis and blood pressure control; defects in ENaC function and regulation are responsible for inherited forms of hypertension and hypotension and may contribute to the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and other lung diseases. An emerging theme is that epithelial Na+ transport is regulated in large part through trafficking mechanisms that control ENaC expression at the cell surface. ENaC trafficking is regulated at multiple steps. Delivery of channels to the cell surface is regulated by aldosterone (and corticosteroids) and vasopressin, which increase ENaC synthesis and exocytosis, respectively. Conversely, endocytosis and degradation is controlled by a sequence located in the C terminus of α, β, and γENaC (PPPXYXXL). This sequence functions as an endocytosis motif and as a binding site for Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin protein ligase that targets ENaC for degradation. Mutations that delete or disrupt this motif cause accumulation of channels at the cell surface, resulting in Liddle’s syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Nedd4-2 is a central convergence point for ENaC regulation by aldosterone and vasopressin; both induce phosphorylation of a common set of three Nedd4-2 residues, which blocks Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC. Thus, aldosterone and vasopressin regulate epithelial Na+ transport in part by altering ENaC trafficking to and from the cell surface.}

  abstract = {The epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) is comprised of three homologous subunits (α, β, and γ). The channel forms the pathway for Na+ absorption in the kidney, and mutations cause disorders of Na+ homeostasis. However, little is known about the mechanisms that control the gating of ENaC. We investigated the gating mechanism by introducing bulky side chains at a position adjacent to the extracellular end of the second membrane spanning segment (549, 520, and 529 in α, β, and γENaC, respectively). Equivalent “DEG” mutations in related DEG/ENaC channels in Caenorhabditis elegans cause swelling neurodegeneration, presumably by increasing channel activity. We found that the Na+ current was increased by mutagenesis or chemical modification of this residue and adjacent residues in α, β, and γENaC. This resulted from a change in the gating of ENaC; modification of a cysteine at position 520 in βENaC increased the open state probability from 0.12 to 0.96. Accessibility to this side chain from the extracellular side was state-dependent; modification occurred only when the channel was in the open conformation. Single-channel conductance decreased when the side chain contained a positive, but not a negative charge. However, alterations in the side chain did not alter the selectivity of ENaC. This is consistent with a location for the DEG residue in the outer vestibule. The results suggest that channel gating involves a conformational change in the outer vestibule of ENaC. Disruption of this mechanism could be important clinically since one of the mutations that increased Na+ current (γN530K) was identified in a patient with renal disease.}

Nedd4-mediated ubiquitination of Cx43 is required to recruit Eps15 and target Cx43 to the endocytic pathway. Although the Cx43 residues that undergo ubiquitination are still unknown, in this study we address other unresolved questions pertaining to the molecular mechanisms mediating the direct interaction between Nedd4 (WW1–3 domains) and Cx43 (carboxyl terminus (CT)). All three WW domains display a similar three antiparallel β-strand structure and interact with the same Cx43CT 283PPXY286 sequence. Although Tyr286 is essential for the interaction, MAPK phosphorylation of the preceding serine residues (Ser(P)279 and Ser(P)282) increases the binding affinity by 2-fold for the WW domains (WW2 {$>$} WW3 ≫ WW1). The structure of the WW2·Cx43CT276–289(Ser(P)279, Ser(P)282) complex reveals that coordination of Ser(P)282 with the end of β-strand 3 enables Ser(P)279 to interact with the back face of β-strand 3 (Tyr286 is on the front face) and loop 2, forming a horseshoe-shaped arrangement. The close sequence identity of WW2 with WW1 and WW3 residues that interact with the Cx43CT PPXY motif and Ser(P)279/Ser(P)282 strongly suggests that the significantly lower binding affinity of WW1 is the result of a more rigid structure. This study presents the first structure illustrating how phosphorylation of the Cx43CT domain helps mediate the interaction with a molecular partner involved in gap junction regulation.}

The channel is composed of three subunits (alphabetagamma) each containing two proline?rich sequences (P1 and P2) at its C?terminus. The P2 regions in human beta and gammaENaC, identical to the rat betagammarENaC, were recently shown to be deleted in patients with Liddle's syndrome (a hereditary form of hypertension), leading to hyperactivation of the channel. Using a yeast two?hybrid screen, we have now identified the rat homologue of Nedd4 (rNedd4) as the binding partner for the P2 regions of beta and gammarENaC. rNedd4 contains a Ca2+ lipid binding (CaLB or C2) domain, three WW domains and a ubiquitin ligase (Hect) domain. Our yeast two?hybrid and in vitro binding studies revealed that the rNedd4?WW domains mediate this association by binding to the P2 regions, which include the PY motifs (XPPXY) of either betarENaC (PPPNY) or gammarENaC (PPPRY). SH3 domains were unable to bind these sequences. Moreover, mutations to Ala of Pro616 or Tyr618 within the betarENaC P2 sequence (to PPANY or PPPNA, respectively), recently described in Liddle's patients, led to abrogation of rNedd4?WW binding. Nedd4?WW domains also bound to the proline?rich C?terminus (containing the sequence PPPAY) of alpharENaC, and endogenous Nedd4 co?immunoprecipitated with alpharENaC expressed in MDCK cells. These results demonstrate that the WW domains of rNedd4 bind to the PY motifs deleted from beta or gammaENaC in Liddle's syndrome patients, and suggest that Nedd4 may be a regulator (suppressor) of the epithelial Na+ channel.}

Abnormalities in channel opening and numbers have been linked to several genetic disorders, including cystic fibrosis, pseudohypoaldosteronism type I and Liddle syndrome. We have recently identified the ubiquitin‐protein ligase Nedd4 as an interacting protein of ENaC. Here we show that ENaC is a short‐lived protein (t1/2 ∼1 h) that is ubiquitinated in vivo on the α and γ (but not β) subunits. Mutation of a cluster of Lys residues (to Arg) at the N‐terminus of γENaC leads to both inhibition of ubiquitination and increased channel activity, an effect augmented by N‐terminal Lys to Arg mutations in αENaC, but not in βENaC. This elevated channel activity is caused by an increase in the number of channels present at the plasma membrane; it represents increases in both cell‐surface retention or recycling of ENaC and incorporation of new channels at the plasma membrane, as determined by Brefeldin A treatment. In addition, we find that the rapid turnover of the total pool of cellular ENaC is attenuated by inhibitors of both the proteasome and the lysosomal/endosomal degradation systems, and propose that whereas the unassembled subunits are degraded by the proteasome, the assembled αβγENaC complex is targeted for lysosomal degradation. Our results suggest that ENaC function is regulated by ubiquitination, and propose a paradigm for ubiquitination‐mediated regulation of ion channels.}

  abstract = {Abstract The epithelial Na+ channel/degenerin (ENaC/DEG) protein family includes a diverse group of ion channels, including nonvoltage-gated Na+ channels of epithelia and neurons, and the acid-sensing ion channel 1 (ASIC1). In mammalian epithelia, ENaC helps regulate Na+ and associated water transport, making it a critical determinant of systemic blood pressure and pulmonary mucosal fluidity. In the nervous system, ENaC/DEG proteins are related to sensory transduction. While the importance and physiological function of these ion channels are established, less is known about their structure. One hallmark of the ENaC/DEG channel family is that each channel subunit has only two transmembrane domains connected by an exceedingly large extracellular loop. This subunit structure was recently confirmed when Jasti and colleagues determined the crystal structure of chicken ASIC1, a neuronal acid-sensing ENaC/DEG channel. By mapping ENaC to the structural coordinates of cASIC1, as we do here, we hope to provide insight toward ENaC structure. ENaC, like ASIC1, appears to be a trimeric channel containing 1α, 1?, and 1? subunit. Heterotrimeric ENaC and monomeric ENaC subunits within the trimer possibly contain many of the major secondary, tertiary, and quaternary features identified in cASIC1 with a few subtle but critical differences. These differences are expected to have profound effects on channel behavior. In particular, they may contribute to ENaC insensitivity to acid and to its constitutive activity in the absence of time- and ligand-dependent inactivation. Experiments resulting from this comparison of cASIC1 and ENaC may help clarify unresolved issues related to ENaC architecture, and may help identify secondary structures and residues critical to ENaC function. ? 2008 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 60(9): 620?628, 2008},

  abstract = {A key aspect of the lung's innate defense system is the ability of the superficial epithelium to regulate airway surface liquid (ASL) volume to maintain a 7-μm periciliary liquid layer (PCL), which is required for cilia to beat and produce mucus flow. The mechanisms whereby airway epithelia regulate ASL height to ≥7 μm are poorly understood. Using bumetanide as an inhibitor of Cl− secretion, and nystatin as an activator of Na+ absorption, we found that a coordinated “blending” of both Cl− secretion and Na+ absorption must occur to effect ASL volume homeostasis. We then investigated how ASL volume status is regulated by the underlying epithelia. Cilia were not critical to this process as (a) ASL volume was normal in cultures from patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia with immotile cilia, and (b) in normal cultures that had not yet undergone ciliogenesis. However, we found that maneuvers that mimic deposition of excess ASL onto the proximal airways, which occurs during mucociliary clearance and after glandular secretion, acutely stimulated Na+ absorption, suggesting that volume regulation was sensitive to changes in concentrations of soluble mediators in the ASL rather than alterations in ciliary beating. To investigate this hypothesis further, we added potential “soluble mediators” to the ASL. ASL volume regulation was sensitive to a channel-activating protein (CAP; trypsin) and a CAP inhibitor (aprotinin), which regulated Na+ absorption via changes in epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity in both normal and cystic fibrosis cultures. ATP was also found to acutely regulate ASL volume by inducing secretion in normal and cystic fibrosis (CF) cultures, while its metabolite adenosine (ADO) evoked secretion in normal cultures but stimulated absorption in CF cultures. Interestingly, the amount of ASL/Cl− secretion elicited by ATP/ADO was influenced by the level of CAP-induced Na+ absorption, suggesting that there are important interactions between the soluble regulators which finely tune ASL volume.}

  abstract = {The acquisition of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data from biological specimens is currently largely uncoupled from subsequent data evaluation, correction and processing. Therefore, the acquisition strategy is difficult to optimize during data collection, often leading to suboptimal microscope usage and disappointing results. Here we provide Warp, a software for real-time evaluation, correction, and processing of cryo-EM data during their acquisition. Warp evaluates and monitors key parameters for each recorded micrograph or tomographic tilt series in real time. Warp also rapidly corrects micrographs for global and local motion, and estimates the local defocus with the use of novel algorithms. The software further includes a deep learning-based particle picking algorithm that rivals human accuracy to make the pre-processing pipeline truly automated. The output from Warp can be directly fed into established tools for particle classification and 3D image reconstruction. In a benchmarking study we show that Warp automatically processed a published cryo-EM data set for influenza virus hemagglutinin, leading to an improvement of the nominal resolution from 3.9 Å to 3.2 Å. Warp is easy to install, computationally inexpensive, and has an intuitive and streamlined user interface.}

In the cortical collecting duct of the kidney, sgk1 regulates sodium transport by stimulating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Control of subcellular localization of sgk1 may be an important mechanism for modulating specificity of sgk1 function; however, which subcellular locations are required for sgk1-regulated ENaC activity in collecting duct cells has yet to be established. Using cell surface biotinylation studies, we detected endogenous sgk1 at the apical cell membrane of aldosterone-stimulated mpkCCDc14 collecting duct cells. The association of sgk1 with the cell membrane was enhanced when ENaC was co-transfected with sgk1 in kidney cells, suggesting that ENaC brings sgk1 to the cell surface. Furthermore, association of endogenous sgk1 with the apical cell membrane of mpkCCDc14 cells could be modulated by treatments that increase or decrease ENaC expression at the apical membrane; forskolin increased the association of sgk1 with the apical surface, whereas methyl-β-cyclodextrin decreased the association of sgk1 with the apical surface. Single channel recordings of excised inside-out patches from the apical membrane of aldosterone-stimulated A6 collecting duct cells revealed that the open probability of ENaC was sensitive to the sgk1 inhibitor GSK650394, indicating that endogenous sgk1 is functionally active at the apical cell membrane. We propose that the association of sgk1 with the apical cell membrane, where it interacts with ENaC, is a novel means by which sgk1 specifically enhances ENaC activity in aldosterone-stimulated collecting duct cells.}

Inherent aberrations of the electromagnetic lenses and other instrumental factors affect the structure factors, however, resulting in decreased accuracy in the determined three-dimensional reconstruction. In contrast, solution x-ray scattering provides absolute and accurate measurement of spherically averaged structure factor amplitudes of particles in solution but does not provide information on the phases. In the present study, we explore the merits of using solution x-ray scattering data to estimate the imaging parameters necessary to make corrections to the structure factor amplitudes derived from electron cryomicroscopic images of icosahedral virus particles. Using 400-kV spot-scan images of the bacteriophage P22 procapsid, we have calculated an amplitude contrast of 8.0±5.2\%. The amplitude decay parameter has been estimated to be 523±188Å2 with image noise compensation and 44±66Å2 without it. These results can also be used to estimate the minimum number of virus particles needed for reconstruction at different resolutions.}

We demonstrate that Nedd4-2 exhibits broad specificity for E2 paralogs of the Ubc4/5 clade to assemble Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains. Full-length Nedd4-2 catalyzes free 125I-polyubiquitin chain assembly by hyperbolic Michaelis–Menten kinetics with respect to Ubc5B∼ubiquitin thioester concentration (Km = 44 ± 6 nm; kcat = 0.020 ± 0.007 s−1) and substrate inhibition above 0.5 μm (Ki = 2.5 ± 1.3 μm) that tends to zero velocity, requiring ordered binding at two functionally distinct E2∼ubiquitin–binding sites. The Ubc5BC85A product analog non-competitively inhibits Nedd4-2 (Ki = 2.0 ± 0.5 μm), consistent with the presence of the second E2-binding site. In contrast, the isosteric Ubc5BC85S-ubiquitin oxyester substrate analog exhibits competitive inhibition at the high-affinity Site 1 (Ki = 720 ± 340 nm) and non-essential activation at the lower-affinity Site 2 (Kact = 750 ± 260 nm). Additional studies utilizing Ubc5BF62A, defective in binding the canonical E2 site, demonstrate that the cryptic Site 1 is associated with thioester formation, whereas binding at the canonical site (Site 2) is associated with polyubiquitin chain elongation. Finally, previously described Ca2+-dependent C2 domain-mediated autoinhibition of Nedd4-2 is not observed under our reported experimental conditions. These studies collectively demonstrate that Nedd4-2 catalyzes polyubiquitin chain assembly by an ordered two-step mechanism requiring two dynamically linked E2∼ubiquitin–binding sites analogous to that recently reported for E6AP, the founding member of the Hect ligase family.}

This conserved catalytic mechanism suggests that NEDD4-2, and presumably all Hect ligases, require oligomerization to catalyze polyubiquitin chain assembly. To explore this hypothesis, we examined the catalytic mechanism of NEDD4-2 through the use of biochemically-defined kinetic assays examining rates of 125I-labeled polyubiquitin chain assembly and biophysical techniques. Results from gel filtration chromatography and dynamic light scattering analyses demonstrate for the first time that active NEDD4-2 is a trimer. Homology modeling to E6AP revealed that the predicted intersubunit interface has an absolutely conserved Phe-823, substitution of which destabilized the trimer and resulted in a ≥104-fold decrease in kcat for polyubiquitin chain assembly. The small-molecule Phe-823 mimic N-acetylphenylalanyl-amide acted as a non-competitive inhibitor (Ki = 8 ± 1.2 mM) of polyubiquitin chain elongation by destabilizing the active trimer, suggesting a mechanism for therapeutically targeting Hect ligases. Additional kinetic experiments indicated that monomeric NEDD4-2 catalyzes only Hect∼ubiquitin thioester formation and monoubiquitination, whereas polyubiquitin chain assembly requires NEDD4-2 oligomerization. These results provide evidence that the previously identified sites 1 and 2 of NEDD4-2 function in trans to support chain elongation, explicating the requirement for oligomerization. Finally, we identified a conserved catalytic ensemble comprising Glu-646 and Arg-604 that supports Hect-ubiquitin thioester exchange and isopeptide bond formation at the active site Cys-922 of NEDD4-2.}

Mammalian prostasins are related to Xenopus channel-activating protease, which stimulates epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) activity in frogs. In human epithelia, prostasin is one of several membrane peptidases proposed to regulate ENaC. This study tests the hypothesis that prostasin can regulate ENaC in cystic fibrosis epithelia in which excessive Na+ uptake contributes to salt and water imbalance. We show that prostasin mRNA and protein are strongly expressed by human airway epithelial cell lines, including immortalized JME/CF15 nasal epithelial cells homozygous for the ?F508 cystic fibrosis mutation. Epithelial cells transfected with vectors encoding recombinant soluble prostasin secrete active, tryptic peptidase that is highly sensitive to inactivation by aprotinin. When studied as monolayers in Ussing chambers, JME/CF15 cells exhibit amiloride-sensitive, transepithelial Na+ currents that are markedly diminished by aprotinin, suggesting regulation by serine-class peptidases. Overproduction of membrane-anchored prostasin in transfected JME/CF15 cells does not augment Na+ currents, and trypsin-induced increases are small, suggesting that baseline serine peptidase-dependent ENaC activation is maximal in these cells. To probe prostasin?s involvement in basal ENaC activity, we silenced expression of prostasin using short interfering RNA targeting of prostasin mRNA?s 3?-untranslated region. This drops ENaC currents to 26 ± 9\% of baseline. These data predict that prostasin is a major regulator of ENaC-mediated Na+ current in ?F508 cystic fibrosis epithelia and suggest that airway prostasin is a target for therapeutic inhibition to normalize ion current in cystic fibrosis airway.}

To accurately characterize liposomes, cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) has been employed as it is the most precise and direct method to determine liposome lamellarity, size, shape and ultrastructure. However, its use is limited by the number of liposomes that can be trapped in the thin layer of ice that spans holes in the perforated carbon film on EM grids. We report a long-incubation method for increasing the density of liposomes in holes. By increasing the incubation time, high liposome density was achieved even with extremely dilute (in the nanomolar range) liposome solutions. This long-incubation method has been successfully employed to study the structure of an ion channel reconstituted into liposomes. This method will also be useful for preparing other biological macromolecules / assemblies for structural studies using cryo-EM.}

The number of channels at the cell surface is tightly regulated; most cells express only a few channels. We have examined the biosynthesis and cell surface expression of ENaC in Xenopus oocytes. The subunits of ENaC are readily synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum, but most of them remain as immature proteins in pre-Golgi compartments, where they are degraded by the proteasomal pathway without apparent ubiquitination. Even when the three subunits, α, β, and γ, are expressed in the same cell, only a very small fraction of the total channel population leave the endoplasmic reticulum, acquire complex oligosaccharides, and reach the plasma membrane. Overexpression of subunits does not increase the number of channels in the plasma membrane but results in the appearance of cytoplasmic subunits in a form not membrane bound. The data indicate that maturation and assembly of the subunits are slow and inefficient processes, and constitute limiting steps for the expression of functional ENaC channels in the plasma membrane.}

  abstract = {Sodium balance, and ultimately blood pressure and extracellular fluid volume, is maintained by precise regulation of the activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)1,2,3. In a Xenopus kidney epithelial cell line (A6), exposure of the apical membrane to theprotease inhibitor aprotinin reduces transepithelial sodium transport. Sodium-channel activity can be restored by subsequent exposure to the nonspecific protease trypsin. Using A6 cells and a functional complementation assay to detect increases in ENaC activity, we have cloned a 329-residue protein belonging to the serine protease family. We show that coexpression of this protein with ENaC in Xenopus oocytes increases the activity of the sodiumchannel by two- to threefold. This channel-activating protease (CAP1) is expressed in kidney, gut, lung, skin and ovary. Sequence analysis predicts that CAP1 is a secreted and/or glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored protein: ENaC activity would thus be regulated by the activity of a protease expressed at the surface of the same cell. This previously undiscovered mechanism for autocrine regulation may apply to other ion channels, in particular to members of the ENaC family that are present in neurons and epithelial cells.}

  abstract = {The resolution value claimed for an electron microscopical three-dimensional reconstruction indicates the overall quality of the experiment. The Fourier shell correlation (FSC) criterion has now become the standard quality measure. However, what has continued to be controversial is the issue of the FSC threshold level at which one defines the reproducible resolution. Here, we discuss the theoretical behaviour of the FSC in conjunction with the various factors which influence it: the number of “voxels” in a given Fourier shell, the symmetry of the structure, and the size of the structure within the reconstruction volume. Both the theoretical considerations and our model experiments show that fixed-valued FSC threshold (like “0.5”) may never be used in a reproducible criterion. Fixed threshold values are—as we show here—simply the result of incorrect assumptions in the basic statistics. Two families of FSC threshold curves are discussed: the σ-factor curves and the new family of bit-based information threshold curves. Whereas σ-factor curves indicate the resolution level at which one has collected information significantly above the noise level, the information curves indicate the resolution level at which enough information has been collected for interpretation.},

  abstract = {The adapter protein Grb10 belongs to a superfamily of related proteins, including Grb7, -10, and -14 and Caenorhabditis elegans Mig10. Grb10 is an interacting partner of the insulin-like growth factor I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR). Previous work showed an inhibitory effect of mouse Grb10 (mGrb10α) on IGF-I-mediated mitogenesis (A. Morrione et al., J. Biol. Chem. 272:26382-26387, 1997). With mGrb10α as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen, mouse Nedd4 (mNedd4-1), a ubiquitin protein ligase, was previously isolated as an interacting protein of Grb10 (A. Morrione et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:24094-24099, 1999). However, Grb10 is not ubiquitinated by Nedd4 in cells. Here we show that in mouse embryo fibroblasts overexpressing Grb10 and the IGF-IR (p6/Grb10), there is a strong ligand-dependent increase in ubiquitination of the IGF-IR compared with that in parental cells (p6). This increased ubiquitination is associated with a shorter half-life and increased internalization of the IGF-IR. The IGF-IR is stabilized following treatment with both MG132 and chloroquine, indicating that both the proteasome and lysosomal pathways mediate degradation of the receptor. Ubiquitination of the IGF-IR likely occurs at the plasma membrane, prior to the formation of endocytic vesicles, as it is insensitive to dansylcadaverine, an inhibitor of early endosome formation in IGF-IR endocytosis. Grb10 coimmunoprecipitates with the IGF-IR and endogenous Nedd4 in p6/Grb10 cells, suggesting the presence of a Grb10/Nedd4/IGF-IR complex. Ubiquitination of the IGF-IR in p6/Grb10 cells is severely impaired by overexpression of a catalytically inactive Nedd4 mutant (Nedd4-CS), which also stabilizes the receptor. Likewise, overexpression of a Grb10 mutant lacking the Src homology 2 (SH2) domain impaired ubiquitination of the IGF-IR in parental p6 and p6/Grb10 cells, indicating that Grb10 binding to Nedd4 is critical for ubiquitination of the receptor. These results suggest a role for the Grb10/Nedd4 complex in regulating ubiquitination and stability of the IGF-IR, and they suggest that Grb10 serves as an adapter to form a bridge between Nedd4 and the IGF-IR. This is the first demonstration of regulation of stability of a tyrosine kinase receptor by the Nedd4 (HECT) family of E3 ligases.}

  abstract = {Aldosterone increases sodium reabsorption across kidney target tubules already before it increases the number of transport proteins, indicating that the early functional response to aldosterone depends on the activation of preexisting channels and pumps. A central mediator of this action is the early aldosterone-induced kinase Sgk1 that de-represses the surface expression and activity of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). A main mechanism by which Sgk1 exerts this de-repression is the phosphorylation of the ubiquitin ligase Nedd4-2 that is thereby prevented from ubiquitylating ENaC. Among a series of new early aldosterone-induced gene products recently identified in kidney target tubules, an additional regulator of ENaC ubiquitylation, the deubiquitylating enzyme Usp2-45, was identified. Coexpression of Usp2-45 was shown to increase ENaC surface expression and activity, and to decrease its ubiquitylation in expression systems, whereas other Usps such as the splice variant Usp2-69 had no effect. Since both Sgk1 and Usp2-45 are similarly induced in distal colon as well, in contrast to other gene products strongly induced in kidney that are not regulated in colon, we suggest that (de)ubiquitylation is the major ENaC regulatory mechanism targeted by aldosterone in the short-term via transcriptional regulation.},

Electrophysiological measurements on lung epithelial cells demonstrated the presence of a Na+ channel that is inhibited by amiloride (K0.5 = 90 nM) and some of its derivatives such as phenamil (K0.5 = 19 nM) and benzamil (K0.5 = 14 nM) but not by ethylisopropylamiloride. An amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel of 4 pS was recorded from outside-out patches excised from the apical membrane. This channel is highly selective for Na+ (PNa+/PK+ \&amp;gt; or = to 10). Isolation of a human lung cDNA led to the primary structure of the lung Na+ channel. The corresponding protein is 669 residues long and has two large hydrophobic domains. An amiloride-sensitive Na(+)-selective current apparently identical to the one observed in lung epithelial cells was recorded after expression of the cloned channel in oocytes. The level of the mRNA for the Na+ channel was highly increased from fetal to newborn and adult stages. This observation indicates that the increased Na+ reabsorption that occurs at birth as a necessary event to pass to an air-breathing environment is probably associated with control of transcription of this Na+ channel. The human gene for the lung Na+ channel was mapped on chromosome 12p13.}

  abstract = {Abstract.  This study examines whether serine proteases can activate the amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (ENaC) in mammalian kidney epithelial cells. The transepithelial sodium transport assessed by amiloride-sensitive short-circuit current appears to be sensitive to aprotinin, a protease inhibitor in a mouse cortical collecting duct cell line (mpkCCDc14). This result indicated that serine proteases may be implicated in the regulation of ENaC-mediated sodium transport. Using degenerated oligonucleotides to a previously isolated serine protease from Xenopus, xCAP1 (channel activating protease), a novel full-length serine protease (mCAP1), has been isolated and characterized. RNA analysis showed a broad pattern of expression in tissues (kidney, lung, colon, and salivary glands) expressing ENaC. Reverse transcription-PCR experiments also showed that mCAP1 was abundantly expressed in proximal tubule cells and was also expressed in intact and cultured collecting duct cells. Coexpression of the Xenopus, rat, or human α-, β-, and γ-ENaC subunits in Xenopus oocytes also showed that mCAP1 induces a significant increase in ENaC-mediated current accompanied by a decrease of channel molecules at the cell surface. It is proposed that this novel mouse channel activating protease may act as a regulator of ENaC within the kidney.}

Epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) function is critical to systems responsible for extracellular fluid homeostasis and gas exchange.

We found that proximal and distal polybasic tracts in ENaC subunits coevolved, consistent with the dual cleavage requirement for activation observed in mammals. Polybasic tract pairs evolved with the terrestrial migration and the appearance of lungs, coincident with the ENaC activator aldosterone, and appeared independently in the α and γ subunits. In summary, sites within ENaC for protease activation developed in vertebrates when renal Na+ conservation and alveolar gas exchange were required for terrestrial survival.},

ENaC is the only constitutively open ion channel in the degenerin/ENaC protein family, and its expression, membrane abundance, and open probability therefore are tightly controlled. The canonical ENaC is composed of three subunits (α, β, and γ), but a fourth δ-subunit may replace α and form atypical δβγ-ENaCs. Using Xenopus laevis as a model, here we found that mRNAs of the α- and δ-subunits are differentially expressed in different tissues and that δ-ENaC predominantly is present in the urogenital tract. Using whole-cell and single-channel electrophysiology of oocytes expressing Xenopus αβγ- or δβγ-ENaC, we demonstrate that the presence of the δ-subunit enhances the amount of current generated by ENaC due to an increased open probability, but also changes current into a transient form. Activity of canonical ENaCs is critically dependent on proteolytic processing of the α- and γ-subunits, and immunoblotting with epitope-tagged ENaC subunits indicated that, unlike α-ENaC, the δ-subunit does not undergo proteolytic maturation by the endogenous protease furin. Furthermore, currents generated by δβγ-ENaC were insensitive to activation by extracellular chymotrypsin, and presence of the δ-subunit prevented cleavage of γ-ENaC at the cell surface. Our findings suggest that subunit composition constitutes an additional level of ENaC regulation, and we propose that the Xenopus δ-ENaC subunit represents a functional example that demonstrates the importance of proteolytic maturation during ENaC evolution.},

The number of active sodium channel complexes present at the plasma membrane appears to be tightly controlled. In Liddle's syndrome, a form of hypertension caused by an increase in the number of active sodium channels at the cell membrane, the betaENaC or gammaENaC subunit gene contains a mutation that disrupts the binding site for the Nedd4 (neuronal precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated gene 4) family of ubiquitin-protein ligases. Therefore ubiquitination of channel subunits may be involved in altering cell surface ENaC. Here, we provide evidence that the ENaC subunits located at the cell surface are modified with multiple mono-ubiquitins (multi-ubiquitination) and that Nedd4-2 modulates this ubiquitination. We confirm that ENaC is associated with the mu2 subunit of the AP-2 (adaptor protein 2) clathrin adaptor. Since mono- or multi-ubiquitination of other membrane proteins is a signal for their internalization by clathrin-mediated endocytosis and subsequent trafficking, our results support a model whereby ubiquitin and clathrin adaptor binding sites act in concert to remove ENaC from the cell surface.},

There have been many infrastructure improvements, including rewrite of previous Java utilities to now use existing or newly written Python utilities in the open-source CCTBX portion of the Phenix software system. This improves long-term maintainability and enhances the thorough integration of MolProbity-style validation within Phenix. There is now a complete MolProbity mirror site at http://molprobity.manchester.ac.uk. GitHub serves our open-source code, reference datasets, and the resulting multi-dimensional distributions that define most validation criteria. Coordinate output after Asn/Gln/His ?flip? correction is now more idealized, since the post-refinement step has apparently often been skipped in the past. Two distinct sets of heavy-atom-to-hydrogen distances and accompanying van der Waals radii have been researched and improved in accuracy, one for the electron-cloud-center positions suitable for X-ray crystallography and one for nuclear positions. New validations include messages at input about problem-causing format irregularities, updates of Ramachandran and rotamer criteria from the million quality-filtered residues in a new reference dataset, the CaBLAM Cα-CO virtual-angle analysis of backbone and secondary structure for cryoEM or low-resolution X-ray, and flagging of the very rare cis-nonProline and twisted peptides which have recently been greatly overused. Due to wide application of MolProbity validation and corrections by the research community, in Phenix, and at the worldwide Protein Data Bank, newly deposited structures have continued to improve greatly as measured by MolProbity's unique all-atom clashscore.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that membrane proteins can be efficiently synthesized in vitro before spontaneously inserting into soluble nanoscale lipid bilayers called nanodiscs (NDs). In this paper, we present experimental details that allow a combination of in vitro translation of ion channels into commercially available NDs followed by their direct reconstitution from these nanobilayers into standard bilayer setups for electrophysiological characterization. We present data showing that two model K+ channels, Kcv and KcsA, as well as a recently discovered dual-topology F− channel, Fluc, can be reliably reconstituted from different types of NDs into bilayers without contamination from the in vitro translation cocktail. The functional properties of Kcv and KcsA were characterized electrophysiologically and exhibited sensitivity to the lipid composition of the target DPhPC bilayer, suggesting that the channel proteins were fully exposed to the target membrane and were no longer surrounded by the lipid/protein scaffold. The single-channel properties of the three tested channels are compatible with studies from recordings of the same proteins in other expression systems. Altogether, the data show that synthesis of ion channels into NDs and their subsequent reconstitution into conventional bilayers provide a fast and reliable method for functional analysis of ion channels.}

Accordingly, Sgk1 is considered to mediate the mineralocorticoid stimulation of renal ENaC activity and antinatriuresis. Here we show that at standard NaCl intake, renal water and electrolyte excretion is indistinguishable in sgk1-knockout (sgk1–/–) mice and wild-type (sgk1+/+) mice. In contrast, dietary NaCl restriction reveals an impaired ability of sgk1–/– mice to adequately decrease Na+ excretion despite increases in plasma aldosterone levels and proximal-tubular Na+ and fluid reabsorption, as well as decreases in blood pressure and glomerular filtration rate.}

So far, four homologous subunits of mammalian ENaC have been isolated and are denoted as α, β, γ, and δ. ENaCδ can associate with β and γ subunits and generate a constitutive current that is 2 orders of magnitude larger than that of homomeric ENaCδ. However, the distribution pattern of ENaCδ is not consistent with that of the β and γ subunits. ENaCδ is expressed mainly in the brain in contrast to β and γ subunits, which are expressed in non-neuronal tissues. To explain this discrepancy, we searched for novel functional properties of homomeric ENaCδ and investigated the detailed tissue distribution in humans. When human ENaCδ was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and Chinese hamster ovary cells, a reduction of extracellular pH activated this channel (half-maximal pH for an activation of 5.0), and the acid-induced current was abolished by amiloride. The most striking finding was that the desensitization of the acid-evoked current was much slower (by ∼10\% 120 s later), dissociating from the kinetics of acid-sensing ion channels in the degenerin/epithelial Na+ channel family, which were rapidly desensitized during acidification. RNA dot-blot analyses showed that ENaCδ mRNA was widely distributed throughout the brain and was also expressed in the heart, kidney, and pancreas in humans. Northern blotting confirmed that ENaCδ was expressed in the cerebellum and the hippocampus. In conclusion, human ENaCδ activity is regulated by protons, indicating that it may contribute to the pH sensation and/or pH regulation in the human brain.}

  abstract = {The mechanisms involved in the regulation of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) via the cAMP pathway are not yet completely understood. The aim of the present study was to investigate cAMP-mediated ENaC regulation in Xenopus laevis oocytes heterologously expressing the three subunits (αβγ) of rat ENaC and to determine the ENaC regions important for mediating the stimulatory effect of cAMP. In oocytes treated for about 24 h with 1 mm 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX) and 1 μm forskolin (FSK) so as to increase intracellular cAMP, the amiloride-sensitive whole cell current (ΔIAmi) was on average 10-fold larger than ΔIAmi in matched control oocytes. This effect on ΔIAmi was paralleled by an increase in ENaC surface expression caused by a reduced rate of ENaC retrieval. In addition, IBMX/FSK also enhanced ENaC open probability from about 0.2 to 0.5. The stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK was dependent on the presence of intact PY motifs in the C termini of the channel. Mutagenesis of putative protein kinase A and CK-2 consensus motifs in the cytosolic domains of the channel did not reveal critical sites involved in mediating the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. In contrast, site-directed mutagenesis of two putative ERK-consensus motifs (T613A in βENaC and T623A in γENaC) largely reduced the stimulatory effect of IBMX/FSK. Phosphorylation of these ERK sites has previously been reported to enhance the interaction of ENaC and Nedd4 (Shi, H., Asher, C., Chigaev, A., Yung, Y., Reuveny, E., Seger, R., and Garty, H. (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277, 13539–13547). Using co-expression experiments we demonstrated that mutating the two ERK sites attenuates the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC currents. We conclude that an increase in intracellular cAMP favors the dephosphorylation of the two ERK sites, which reduces channel retrieval and increases PO by modulating ENaC/Nedd4 interaction. This defines a novel regulatory pathway likely to be relevant for cAMP-induced stimulation of ENaC in vivo.}

From the mean radial amplitude spectra of overfocused images, amplitude contrast was estimated to be 6.9±1.9\% and 2.7±1.0\% of the whole contrast at the low spatial frequency range with and without energy filtering, respectively, and that of the carbon film to be 9.5±2.0\% and 5.8±1.8\%. Energy filtering effectively doubled the signal-to-noise ratio in the images of frozen-hydrated filaments, and substantially improved intensity data statistics of layer lines up to at least ∼25Å resolution in their Fourier transforms. It also markedly improved inter-particle fitting phase residuals of averaged data at resolutions up to ∼15Å. Using the energy filtered data recorded on a new high-performance, lens-coupled CCD camera the three-dimensional map of the flagellar filament was calculated at 8Å by applying the amplitude contrast of 6.9\%.

  abstract = {The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) of the kidney is necessary for extracellular volume homeostasis and normal arterial BP. Activity of ENaC is enhanced by proteolytic cleavage of the γ-subunit and putative release of a 43-amino acid inhibitory tract from the γ-subunit ectodomain. We hypothesized that proteolytic processing of γENaC occurs in the human kidney under physiologic conditions and that proteinuria contributes to aberrant proteolytic activation. Here, we used monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with specificity to the human 43-mer inhibitory tract (N and C termini, mAbinhibit, and mAb4C11) and the neoepitope generated after proteolytic cleavage at the prostasin/kallikrein cleavage site (K181-V182 and mAbprostasin) to examine human nephrectomy specimens. By immunoblotting, kidney cortex homogenate from patients treated with angiotensin II type 1 receptor antagonists (n=6) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (n=6) exhibited no significant difference in the amount of full-length or furin-cleaved γENaC or the furin-cleaved–to–full-length ratio of γENaC compared with homogenate from patients on no medication (n=5). Patients treated with diuretics (n=4) displayed higher abundance of full-length and furin-cleaved γENaC, with no significant change in the furin-cleaved–to–full-length γENaC ratio. In patients with proteinuria (n=6), the inhibitory tract was detected only in full-length γENaC by mAbinhibit. Prostasin/kallikrein-cleaved γENaC was detected consistently only in tissue from patients with proteinuria and observed in collecting ducts. In conclusion, human kidney γENaC is subject to proteolytic cleavage, yielding fragments compatible with furin cleavage, and proteinuria is associated with cleavage at the putative prostasin/kallikrein site and removal of the inhibitory tract within γENaC.},

The elevated systolic blood pressure was completely reversed by inhibition of cholesterol (Cho) synthesis with lovastatin. Inside-out patch-clamp data show that intracellular Cho stimulated ENaC in cultured distal nephron cells by interacting with phosphatidylinositol‑4,5‑bisphosphate (PIP2), an ENaC activator. Confocal microscopy data show that both α‑ENaC and PIP2 were localized in microvilli via a Cho-dependent mechanism. Deletion of membrane Cho reduced the levels of γ‑ENaC in the apical membrane. Reduced ABCA1 expression and elevated intracellular Cho were observed in old mice, compared to young mice. In parallel, cell-attached patch-clamp data from the split-open cortical collecting ducts (CCD) show that ENaC activity was significantly increased in old mice. These data suggest that elevation of intracellular Cho due to blockade of ABCA1 stimulates ENaC, which may contribute to CsA-induced hypertension. This study also implies that reduced ABCA1 expression may mediate age-related hypertension by increasing ENaC activity via elevation of intracellular Cho.},

Here, a GPU-accelerated computer program, Gctf, for accurate and robust, real-time CTF determination is presented. The main target of Gctf is to maximize the cross-correlation of a simulated CTF with the logarithmic amplitude spectra (LAS) of observed micrographs after background subtraction. Novel approaches in Gctf improve both speed and accuracy. In addition to GPU acceleration (e.g. 10–50×), a fast ‘1-dimensional search plus 2-dimensional refinement (1S2R)’ procedure further speeds up Gctf. Based on the global CTF determination, the local defocus for each particle and for single frames of movies is accurately refined, which improves CTF parameters of all particles for subsequent image processing. Novel diagnosis method using equiphase averaging (EPA) and self-consistency verification procedures have also been implemented in the program for practical use, especially for aims of near-atomic reconstruction. Gctf is an independent program and the outputs can be easily imported into other cryoEM software such as Relion (Scheres, 2012) and Frealign (Grigorieff, 2007). The results from several representative datasets are shown and discussed in this paper.}

  abstract = {Epithelial Na+ channels (ENaCs) and related channels have large extracellular domains where specific factors interact and induce conformational changes, leading to altered channel activity. However, extracellular structural transitions associated with changes in ENaC activity are not well defined. Using crosslinking and two-electrode voltage clamp in Xenopus oocytes, we identified several pairs of functional intersubunit contacts where mouse ENaC activity was modulated by inducing or breaking a disulfide bond between introduced Cys residues. Specifically, crosslinking E499C in the β-subunit palm domain and N510C in the α-subunit palm domain activated ENaC, whereas crosslinking βE499C with αQ441C in the α-subunit thumb domain inhibited ENaC. We determined that bridging βE499C to αN510C or αQ441C altered the Na+ self-inhibition response via distinct mechanisms. Similar to bridging βE499C and αQ441C, we found that crosslinking palm domain αE557C with thumb domain γQ398C strongly inhibited ENaC activity. In conclusion, we propose that certain residues at specific subunit interfaces form microswitches that convey a conformational wave during ENaC gating and its regulation.},

Recent studies have provided deeper mechanistic insights into their catalysis, activation, and regulation. In this review, we summarize the current progress in structure?function studies of ubiquitin ligases as well as exciting new discoveries of novel classes of E3s and diverse substrate recognition mechanisms.

  abstract = {Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK) plays a key role in the regulation of epithelial Na+ transport. SGK phosphorylates Nedd4-2, an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC) for degradation. Phosphorylation increases Na+ transport by reducing Nedd4-2 binding to ENaC, which increases ENaC expression at the cell surface. Thus, SGK expression must be tightly controlled to maintain Na+ homeostasis. This occurs in part by regulation of SGK transcription; a variety of signals including steroid hormones (aldosterone and glucocorticoids) increase SGK levels by inducing transcription of SGK. However, SGK has a short half-life, suggesting that SGK levels might also be controlled by regulation of SGK degradation. Here we found that SGK degradation is mediated in part by Nedd4-2. Consistent with this model, overexpression of Nedd4-2 decreased steady-state levels of SGK in a dose-dependent manner by increasing SGK ubiquitination and degradation in the 26S proteasome. Conversely, silencing of Nedd4-2 by RNA interference stabilized SGK. Nedd4-2 phosphorylation potentiates SGK degradation; degradation was reduced by Nedd4-2 and SGK mutations that disrupt phosphorylation or by inhibition of SGK kinase activity. Together with previous work, the data support a model in which SGK and Nedd4-2 regulate one another in a reciprocal manner. SGK phosphorylates Nedd4-2, which reduces Nedd4-2 binding and inhibition of ENaC. Conversely, phosphorylation increases Nedd4-2-mediated degradation of SGK. Thus, by phosphorylating Nedd4-2, SGK induces its own degradation. This feedback inhibition may fine-tune the regulation of epithelial Na+ absorption.}

Defects in this regulation cause Liddle syndrome, an inherited form of hypertension. Previous work found that Nedd4-2 binds to ENaC via PY motifs located in the C termini of α-, β-, and γENaC. However, little is known about the mechanism by which Nedd4-2 regulates ENaC surface expression. Here we found that Nedd4-2 catalyzes ubiquitination of α-, β-, and γENaC; Nedd4-2 overexpression increased ubiquitination, whereas Nedd4-2 silencing decreased ubiquitination. Although Nedd4-2 increased both mono/oligoubiquitinated and multiubiquitinated forms of ENaC, monoubiquitination was sufficient for Nedd4-2 to reduce ENaC surface expression and reduce ENaC current. Ubiquitination was disrupted by Liddle syndrome-associated mutations in ENaC or mutation of the catalytic HECT domain in Nedd4-2. Several findings suggest that the interaction between Nedd4-2 and ENaC is localized to the cell surface. First, Nedd4-2 bound to a population of ENaC at the cell surface. Second, Nedd4-2 catalyzed ubiquitination of cell surface ENaC. Third, Nedd4-2 selectively reduced ENaC expression at the cell surface but did not alter the quantity of immature ENaC in the biosynthetic pathway. Finally, Nedd4-2 induced degradation of the cell surface pool of ENaC. Together, the data suggest a model in which Nedd4-2 binds to and ubiquitinates ENaC at the cell surface, which targets surface ENaC for degradation, and thus, reduces epithelial Na+ transport.}

  abstract = {Cryoelectron microscopy provides the means of studying macromolecules in their native state. However, the contrast transfer function (CTF) makes the images and the three-dimensional (3D) maps derived from them difficult to interpret. We developed methods to determine the CTF from experimental data and to obtain a CTF-corrected 3D reconstruction. The CTF correction and 3D reconstruction accomplished in one step make it easy to combine different defocus data sets and decrease the error accumulation in the computation. These methods were applied to energy-filtered images of the 70SEscherichia coliribosome, resulting in a distortion-free 3D map of the ribosome at 1/24.5 Å−1resolution, as determined by the differential phase residual resolution criterion.}

  abstract = {Mechanistic and structural studies of membrane proteins require their stabilization in specific conformations. Single domain antibodies are potent reagents for this purpose, but their generation relies on immunizations, which impedes selections in the presence of ligands typically needed to populate defined conformational states. To overcome this key limitation, we developed an in vitro selection platform based on synthetic single domain antibodies named sybodies. To target the limited hydrophilic surfaces of membrane proteins, we designed three sybody libraries that exhibit different shapes and moderate hydrophobicity of the randomized surface. A robust binder selection cascade combining ribosome and phage display enabled the generation of conformation-selective, high affinity sybodies against an ABC transporter and two previously intractable human SLC transporters, GlyT1 and ENT1. The platform does not require access to animal facilities and builds exclusively on commercially available reagents, thus enabling every lab to rapidly generate binders against challenging membrane proteins.},

  abstract = {Here, we describe the third major release of RELION. CPU-based vector acceleration has been added in addition to GPU support, which provides flexibility in use of resources and avoids memory limitations. Reference-free autopicking with Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtering and execution of jobs from python allows non-interactive processing during acquisition, including 2D-classification, de novo model generation and 3D-classification. Per-particle refinement of CTF parameters and correction of estimated beam tilt provides higher resolution reconstructions when particles are at different heights in the ice, and/or coma-free alignment has not been optimal. Ewald sphere curvature correction improves resolution for large particles. We illustrate these developments with publicly available data sets: together with a Bayesian approach to beam-induced motion correction it leads to resolution improvements of 0.2–0.7 Å compared to previous RELION versions.},

  abstract = {Methods are presented that detect three types of aberrations in single-particle cryo-EM data sets: symmetrical and antisymmetrical optical aberrations and magnification anisotropy. Because these methods only depend on the availability of a preliminary 3D reconstruction from the data, they can be used to correct for these aberrations for any given cryo-EM data set, a posteriori. Using five publicly available data sets, it is shown that considering these aberrations improves the resolution of the 3D reconstruction when these effects are present. The methods are implemented in version 3.1 of the open-source software package RELION.},
