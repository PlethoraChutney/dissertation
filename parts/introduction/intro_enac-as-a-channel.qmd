# ENaC Currents, Structure, and Gating

<!-- TODO: I actually think we should go currents -> structure and reg together -->
In this chapter I begin with an overview of proteins that directly act upon ENaC to modify its P~O~ --- proteases, kinases, and small molecules.
I next indulge in a brief evolutionary detour to provide some context in the form of closely-related channels.
Finally, I discuss characteristic traits of ENaC currents and the hypothesized molecular mechanism by which the channel opens.

## ENaC Structure

ENaC is a heterotrimeric protein comprising one copy each of &alpha;ENaC, &beta;ENaC, and &gamma;ENaC arranged clockwise when viewed from the extracellular side.
Each subunit is approximately 30% identical to the others, and all three share a topology common to the entire ENaC/DEG family.[This is only marginally higher than the approximately 25% identity they each have with related channel ASIC1.]{.aside}
In this section I will provide an overview of previous findings from our lab [@noreng18; @noreng20].

I will also make extensive analogy to a closely-related channel, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC).
ASIC is another member of the ENaC/DEG family which is activated by protons.
I recommend Yoder and colleagues' excellent overview of ASIC's gating mechanism to interested readers [@yoder2018].

![Cartoon representation of an ENaC subunit. Each domain is labeled, and important functions are noted next to the labels.](figures/domain-cartoon/enac-overview.png){#fig-intro_domain-cartoon}

Each subunit has short intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2), and a relatively large extracellular domain (ECD), which is further subdivided into domains named for their vague resemblance of a left hand grasping a ball (@fig-intro_domain-cartoon).
All told, the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits are 75, 72, and 74&nbsp;kDa respectively.
Uncleaved channels typically run a bit higher (between 75 and 90&nbsp;kDa) on SDS-PAGE due to SDS binding and extensive glycosylation.

### The palm, &beta;-ball, and knuckle
The palm (yellow) comprises a twisted &beta;-sheet of seven &beta;-strands (&beta;1, 3, 6, and 9&ndash;12).
The &beta;-ball forms (as one might expect) a tightly-twisted ball of four &beta;-strands: &beta;2, 4, 5, and 7.
The knuckle, comprising only a single &alpha;-helix (&alpha;6) is connected to the extracellular end of the palm.

Although the palm does lie along the pseudo-threefold symmetry axis, the ion permeation pathway of ASIC suggests that it is probably not involved in passing Na^+^ currents [@baconguis2012].
The palm instead forms the structural scaffold of each subunit, connecting the finger and knuckle at the extracellular edge of the domain to the thumb at the membrane-adjacent end.
About a third of each subunit's buried surface area (1,667 out of 4,662&nbsp;&Aring;^2^ for &alpha;ENaC) is in the palm, despite it containing only about a fifth of the modeled residues.
Given this outsize role in establishing channel topology, it is no surprise that the palm likely plays a pivotal role in channel gating.

When ASIC opens, the palm pivots around the &beta;-ball (orange), moving inward by approximately 4&nbsp;&Aring; [@baconguis2014].
This movement is coupled to the TMD, opening the pore.
The same overall mechanism is expected in ENaC and has support from cross-linking studies [@zhang2023].
The &alpha; and &beta; palm domains and the &alpha; knuckle also host glycosylation sites (discussed further in ) which are required for mechanosensitive gating.
<!-- TODO: reference glyc -->

In ASIC, the knuckle is largely uninvolved in gating and is considered a rather inert part of the palm/knuckle scaffold.
In contrast, ENaC's knuckle is an important source of heterogeneity between the three subunits.
The carboxyl terminus of &alpha;6 differs between the three subunits, and its interface with the adjacent subunit's finger domain may contribute to the enforcement of a clockwise subunit arrangement [@noreng20].

## Direct regulation of ENaC

### Proteases

Proteolytic activation of ENaC was discovered shortly after the channel itself.
Overnight treatment of *Xenopus laevis* bladder with aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) dramatically reduced ENaC currents; the same effect was observed in an *X. laevis* cell line [@orce1980; @vallet1997].
ENaC currents were quickly rescued by treatment with the serine protease trypsin.
Thus, an activating role for proteases was established.

The first indication that proteases acted directly upon ENaC appeared when researchers observed multiple distinct populations of ENaC at the cell surface, ranging from the so-called "near-silent" population with a low P~O~ (less than 0.02) to the high P~O~ channels which are essentially constitutively open (P~O~ &cong; 0.9) [@firsov1996; @palmer1996].
Treatment with exogenous trypsin activated the near-silent channels [@caldwell2004].
And, finally, Hughey and colleagues reported direct cleavage of ENaC itself [@hughey2004].

Prostasin was the first protease found to activate ENaC [@vallet1997].[The first prostasin homolog described was that of *X. laevis*, where it is still named Channel Activating Protease 1 (CAP1) for this reason.]{.aside}
Furin's role in channel activation was reported shortly thereafter [@hughey2004].
Prostasin is a membrane-associate serine protease, expressed highly in prostate and seminal fluid and moderately in other tissues including colon, lung, and kidney [@yu1994].
In contrast to prostasin's relatively circumscribed expression, furin (also a serine protease) is expressed in essentially all human tissues.
Furin plays a role in a vast array of biological processes including ENaC activation and is well-reviewed by Thomas [@thomas2002].

Both furin and prostasin are enteropeptidases which cleave following polybasic tracts (i.e., stretches of amino acids with multiple Lys or Arg residues).
Both &alpha;ENaC and &gamma;ENaC have canonical cleavage sites in their extracellular domains [@hughey2004].
The relative contribution of each of these sites to P~O~ is still unclear and seems to be tissue dependent.
The hypothetical molecular mechanism of channel opening is covered in more detail in.
<!-- TODO: crossref GRIP section -->
In addition to prostasin, &gamma;ENaC is also cleaved and activated by a wide repertoire of different proteases in different tissues [@adebamiro2007; @garcia-caballero2008; @caldwell2005; @garcia-caballero2011; @haerteis2012; @ji2015; @passero2012; @passero2008; @patel2012; @svenningsen2009; @tan2014].

Proteolytic activation has been described in great detail in a wide range of *in vitro* systems, but the link is not quite so obvious *in vivo*.
For instance, mice treated with aprotinin show reduced ENaC activity as expected [@bohnert2018].
However, when mice are fed a low-sodium diet, the appearance of cleaved ENaC and increases in amiloride-sensitive current are largely independent [@frindt2018].
It is thus not obvious that the direct cleavage/current relationship observed *in vitro* is true *in vivo*.
What's more, while proteolytic cleavage may be the main pathway by which ENaC is opened, ENaC is also sensitive to other signals.

### The membrane {#sec-intro-membrane}

#### Phospholipids {#sec-intro-phospholipids}

Like many ion channels, ENaC is modulated by phospholipids.
For instance, ENaC is known to segregate into lipid rafts [@hill02; @hill07].[Lipid rafts are proposed regions of the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. While there is clearly some kind of spatial-compositional heterogeneity in cell membranes, the existence of lipid rafts in particular is still an open question [@shaw2006; @hill07].]{.aside}
Cholesterol alone does not activate the channel, but it does facilitate the interaction between phosphatidylinositol and binding sites in the &beta; and &gamma; subunits [@archer2020; @zhai19].
This interaction is absolutely required for ENaC opening.

Treatment of inside-out patches with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP~2~) increases ENaC P~O~ within seconds, and P~O~ is reduced again upon PIP~2~ removal, ruling out the possibility of PIP~2~-induced proteolytic cleavage [@ma2002; @pochynyuk2006].
Similarly, no change in channel number is observed in these experiments PIP~2~.
A similar dependence of ENaC current on PIP~2~ levels is observed in mouse trachea [@kunzelmann2005].
Note that more PIP~2~ than is necessary does not result in greater ENaC currents --- that is, a lack of PIP~2~ reduces ENaC currents but PIP~2~ does not itself potentiate them [@markadieu2004].

Unlike PIP~2~, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP~3~) does augment ENaC currents both directly and via a signaling cascade.
In its immediate effect, PIP~3~ binds &gamma;ENaC just after the second transmembrane domain to rapidly open the channel [@markadieu2004; @tong2004b; @pochynyuk2005].[Interestingly, mutation of negatively-charged residues in the &gamma;ENaC PIP~3~ binding site increases ENaC currents both with *and* without PIP~3~ [@pochynyuk2005].]{.aside}
PIP~3~ also increases the number of channels at the cell surface in a longer cascade mediated by SGK (@sec-intro_sgk) [@paunescu2000].
In fact, aldosterone's effect on SGK is mediated by PI3K and PIP~3~ [@tong2004a].

ENaC's dependence on phosphatidylinositols presents a problem.
PIPs are rare enough in the membrane that, if the lipids and channel were both freely diffusing, the expected P~O~ of ENaC would be far lower than what is observed [@ingolfsson2014; @bao2014].
MARCKS is a lipid-binding protein which sequesters PIP~2~ and PIP~3~ into regions of high local concentration [@wang2002].
MARCKS also binds ENaC, potentially anchoring the channel in a region of the membrane with a high enough local concentration PIPs for the proper channel P~O~ [@alli2012].[MARCKS is itself subject to regulation by a wide range of signals, which in turn affect ENaC currents. For instance, ENaC currents depend on Ca^2+^ in an effect mediated by calmodulin and then MARCKS [@alli2015]. In an amusing symmetry, MARCKS is itself regulated by proteolysis [@montgomery2017].]{.aside}

#### Palmitoylation

Palmitoylation is a reversible process in which hydrophobic chains are attached to cysteine residues, anchoring them in the membrane.
Multiple cysteines in &beta;- and &gamma;ENaC are palmitoylated (but none in &alpha;ENaC), with varying effects [@mueller10; @mueller12; @mukherjee14].

Blocking palmitoylation of two cysteines in &beta;ENaC (in mouse: C43 and C557) significantly reduces ENaC currents [@mueller10].
This effect is not mediated by differences in trafficking or cleavage but by changes in channel P~O~, specifically increased SSI.
C43 is suggestively close to the HG motif; it may be that membrane anchoring of this cysteine aids in proper folding of the re-entrant loop and therefore the pore.
This conjecture is supported by the observation in the same study that C557A mutants have significantly increased unitary conductance.

&gamma;ENaC also has two palmitoylated cysteines, C33 and C41, which straddle that subunit's HG motif [@mukherjee14].
Again, C&rarr;A mutation of these cysteines increase SSI without affecting surface exposure or channel cleavage.
Surprisingly, addition of a &beta; palmitoylation mutant to a mutant &gamma; background does not further reduce currents --- put another way, the &gamma; mutations are dominant.
