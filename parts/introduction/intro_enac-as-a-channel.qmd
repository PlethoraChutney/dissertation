# ENaC Gating and Currents

In this chapter I begin with an overview of proteins that directly act upon ENaC to modify its P~O~ &mdash; proteases, kinases, and small molecules.
I next indulge in a brief evolutionary detour to provide some context in the form of closely-related channels.
Finally, I discuss characteristic traits of ENaC currents and the hypothesized molecular mechanism by which the channel opens.

## Direct regulation of ENaC

### Proteases

Proteolytic activation of ENaC was discovered shortly after the channel itself.
Overnight treatment of *Xenopus laevis* bladder with aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) dramatically reduced ENaC currents; the same effect was observed in an *X. laevis* cell line [@orce1980; @vallet1997].
ENaC currents were quickly rescued by treatment with the serine protease trypsin.
Thus, an activating role for proteases was established.

The first indication that proteases acted directly upon ENaC appeared when researchers observed multiple distinct populations of ENaC at the cell surface, ranging from the so-called "near-silent" population with a low P~O~ (less than 0.02) to the high P~O~ channels which are essentially constitutively open (P~O~ &cong; 0.9) [@firsov1996; @palmer1996].
Treatment with exogenous trypsin activated the near-silent channels [@caldwell2004].
And, finally, Hughey and colleagues reported direct cleavage of ENaC itself [@hughey2004].

Prostasin was the first protease found to activate ENaC [@vallet1997].[The first prostasin homolog described was that of *X. laevis*, where it is still named Channel Activating Protease 1 (CAP1) for this reason.]{.aside}
Furin's role in channel activation was reported shortly thereafter [@hughey2004].
Prostasin is a membrane-associate serine protease, expressed highly in prostate and seminal fluid and moderately in other tissues including colon, lung, and kidney [@yu1994].
In contrast to prostasin's relatively circumscribed expression, furin (also a serine protease) is expressed in essentially all human tissues.
Furin plays a role in a vast array of biological processes including ENaC activation and is well-reviewed by Thomas [@thomas2002].

Both furin and prostasin are enteropeptidases which cleave following polybasic tracts (i.e., stretches of amino acids with multiple Lys or Arg residues).
Both &alpha;ENaC and &gamma;ENaC have canonical cleavage sites in their extracellular domains [@hughey2004].
The relative contribution of each of these sites to P~O~ is still unclear and seems to be tissue dependent.
The hypothetical molecular mechanism of channel opening is covered in more detail in.
<!-- TODO: crossref GRIP section -->
In addition to prostasin, &gamma;ENaC is also cleaved and activated by a wide repertoire of different proteases in different tissues [@adebamiro2007; @garcia-caballero2008; @caldwell2005; @garcia-caballero2011; @haerteis2012; @ji2015; @passero2012; @passero2008; @patel2012; @svenningsen2009; @tan2014].

Proteolytic activation has been described in great detail in a wide range of *in vitro* systems, but the link is not quite so obvious *in vivo*.
For instance, mice treated with aprotinin show reduced ENaC activity as expected [@bohnert2018].
However, when mice are fed a low-sodium diet, the appearance of cleaved ENaC and increases in amiloride-sensitive current are largely independent [@frindt2018].
It is thus not obvious that the direct cleavage/current relationship observed *in vitro* is true *in vivo*.
What's more, while proteolytic cleavage may be the main pathway by which ENaC is opened, ENaC is also sensitive to other signals.

### The membrane

Like many membrane proteins, ENaC is sensitive to lipid composition, especially phospholipids.
For instance, ENaC is known to segregate into lipid rafts [@hill02; @hill07].[Lipid rafts are proposed regions of the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. While there is clearly some kind of spatial-compositional heterogeneity in cell membranes, the existence of lipid rafts in particular is still an open question [@shaw2006; @hill07].]{.aside}
Cholesterol alone does not activate the channel, but it does facilitate the interaction between phosphatidylinositol and binding sites in the &beta; and &gamma; subunits [@archer2020; @zhai19].
This interaction is absolutely required for ENaC opening.

Treatment of inside-out patches with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP~2~) increases ENaC P~O~ within seconds, and P~O~ is reduced again upon PIP~2~ removal, ruling out the possibility of PIP~2~-induced proteolytic cleavage [@ma2002; @pochynyuk2006].
Similarly, no change in channel number is observed in these experiments PIP~2~.
A similar dependence of ENaC current on PIP~2~ levels is observed in mouse trachea [@kunzelmann2005].
Note that more PIP~2~ than is necessary does not result in greater ENaC currents &mdash; that is, a lack of PIP~2~ reduces ENaC currents but PIP~2~ does not itself potentiate them. [@markadieu2004].

The same study found that phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP~3~) does augment ENaC currents.
