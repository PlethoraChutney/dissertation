# ENaC Currents, Structure, and Gating {#sec-intro_as-a-channel}

<!-- TODO: I actually think we should go currents -> structure and reg together -->
In this chapter I begin with an overview of proteins that directly act upon ENaC to modify its P~O~ --- proteases, kinases, and small molecules.
I next indulge in a brief evolutionary detour to provide some context in the form of closely-related channels.
Finally, I discuss characteristic traits of ENaC currents and the hypothesized molecular mechanism by which the channel opens.

## ENaC Structure {#sec-intro_structure}

ENaC is a heterotrimeric protein comprising one copy each of &alpha;ENaC, &beta;ENaC, and &gamma;ENaC arranged clockwise when viewed from the extracellular side.
Each subunit is approximately 30% identical to the others, and all three share a topology common to the entire ENaC/DEG family.[This is only marginally higher than the approximately 25% identity they each have with related channel ASIC1.]{.aside}
In this section, I will cover structure/function relationships for the two main sections of ENaC: the extracellular and transmembrane domains (ECD and TMD, respectively).

I will also make extensive analogy to a closely-related channel, the acid-sensing ion channel (ASIC).
Throughout this document, when I refer to ASIC, I specifically mean ASIC1 unless I specify a different paralog.
ASIC is another member of the ENaC/DEG family which is activated by protons.
I recommend Yoder and colleagues' excellent overview of ASIC's gating mechanism to interested readers [@yoder2018].

The first structures of a third ENaC/DEG family member, FMRFamide-gated sodium channel 1 (FaNaC 1; hereafter FaNaC), were published during the production of this document [@valeriakalienkova2023].
This is exciting for two reasons.
First, FaNaC is much more closely related to ENaC than ASIC is [@aguilar-camacho2023].
Second, FaNaC shares its overall architecture with ENaC and ASIC, aside from divergence at the ligand-recognition region of the distal finger.
These similarities further support a shared overall gating mechanism among the ENaC/DEG family.

To date, all solved structures of the ENaC/DEG family are trimeric.
Prior to the first structure of ASIC, functional studies of the channel suggested a tetrameric, &alpha;&alpha;&beta;&gamma; channel &mdash; Kashlan and Kleyman discuss the abandonment of the tetrameric hypothesis well [@kashlan11].
Although homomeric &alpha;ENaC channels are competent to pass very small amiloride-sensitive currents, expressing all three subunits results in currents over 100 times larger than the &alpha;-only channels [@canessa1994].
Thus, the canonical ENaC channel is the &alpha;&beta;&gamma; heterotrimer.

As discussed in @sec-intro_enac-in-body, it is not clear that this canonical channel is the only one expressed in the body.
No tissue assayed thus far expresses all three subunits in equal amounts (in some cases, one or more subunits are not expressed at all).
Aldosterone rarely induces expression of all three channels equally.
More strikingly, the regulatory protein SPLUNC1 binds to &beta;ENaC in the lumen and induces internalization of &alpha;- and &gamma;- (but **not** &beta;-) ENaC [@kim18].
It is not clear how a small (26&nbsp;kDa), secreted protein could separate &beta;ENaC from the &alpha; and &gamma; subunits alone.
Indeed, the same study indicates that &beta;ENaC becomes less mobile upon SPLUNC1 binding, suggesting coupling to other, larger proteins.
A deeper investigation of the various chaperones and processes involved in ENaC assembly and dissociation would be interesting, but is outside the scope of this work.
For our purposes, ENaC is the &alpha;&beta;&gamma; heterotrimer.

![Cartoon representation of an ENaC subunit. Each domain is labeled, and important functions are noted next to the labels.](figures/domain-cartoon/enac-overview.png){#fig-intro_domain-cartoon}

Each subunit has short intracellular N- and C-terminal tails, two transmembrane helices (TM1 and TM2, which together form the transmembrane domain, TMD), and a relatively large extracellular domain (ECD), which is further subdivided into domains named for their vague resemblance of a left hand grasping a ball (@fig-intro_domain-cartoon).
All told, the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits are 75, 72, and 74&nbsp;kDa respectively.
Uncleaved channels typically run a bit higher (between 90 and 120&nbsp;kDa) on SDS-PAGE due to SDS binding and extensive glycosylation (@sec-intro_glycosylation).

### Scaffolding &mdash; the palm, &beta;-ball, and knuckle
The palm (yellow) comprises a twisted &beta;-sheet of seven &beta;-strands (&beta;1, 3, 6, and 9&ndash;12).
The &beta;-ball forms (as one might expect) a tightly-twisted ball of four &beta;-strands: &beta;2, 4, 5, and 7.
The knuckle, comprising only a single &alpha;-helix (&alpha;6) is connected to the extracellular end of the palm.

Although the palm does lie along the pseudo-threefold symmetry axis, the ion permeation pathway of ASIC suggests that it is probably not involved in passing Na^+^ currents [@baconguis2012].
The palm instead forms the structural scaffold of each subunit, connecting the finger and knuckle at the extracellular edge of the domain to the thumb at the membrane-adjacent end.
About a third of each subunit's buried surface area (1,667 out of 4,662&nbsp;&Aring;^2^ for &alpha;ENaC) is in the palm, despite it containing only about a fifth of the modeled residues.
Given this outsize role in establishing channel topology, it is no surprise that the palm likely plays a pivotal role in channel gating.

When ASIC opens, the palm pivots around the &beta;-ball (orange), moving inward by approximately 4&nbsp;&Aring; [@baconguis2014].
This movement is coupled to the TMD, opening the pore.
The same overall mechanism is expected in ENaC and has support from cross-linking studies [@zhang2023].
The &alpha; and &beta; palm domains and the &alpha; knuckle also host glycosylation sites which are required for mechanosensitive gating (@sec-intro_mechano).

In ASIC, the knuckle is largely uninvolved in gating and is considered a rather inert part of the palm/knuckle scaffold.
In contrast, ENaC's knuckle is an important source of heterogeneity between the three subunits.
The carboxyl terminus of &alpha;6 differs between the three subunits, and its interface with the adjacent subunit's finger domain may contribute to the enforcement of a clockwise subunit arrangement [@noreng20].

### Gating &mdash; the finger, thumb, and GRIP {#sec-intro_structure-gating}

The finger, thumb, and gating relief of inhibition by proteolysis (GRIP) domains form the essential regulatory machinery of the channel.[When we were publishing the first structure of ENaC, we struggled to find a good backronym for GRIP. My suggestion of Good, Really Important Part was rejected.]{.aside}
The finger domain (blue) comprises three alpha helices (&alpha;1&ndash;3).
The thumb domain (green) comprises two large helices, &alpha;4 and 5.

The &alpha;- and &gamma;GRIP domains (cyan) are, as the name painstakingly makes clear, expected to be proteolytically removed in order to open the channel (see @sec-intro_proteolysis).
The &beta;GRIP is not cleaved during canonical channel opening and is, perhaps relatedly, the GRIP for which we have the best structural information.
We can model a sheet of two anti-parallel pairs of &beta;-strands in &beta;GRIP.
The GRIP domain shrouds the interface between the finger and thumb, forming extensive contacts between the two.

In ASIC, protonation of an acidic pocket formed by the &beta;-ball, finger, and thumb of a single subunit causes collapse of the thumb toward the finger.
This pulls the palm (and therefore the TMD) away from the symmetry axis, opening the channel.
In ENaC, no such acidic residues exist.
Instead, an aromatic pocket is formed by the finger, thumb, and GRIP domains.
Based on this similar architecture and a slew of cross linking studies, it is thought that the GRIP domain forms a wedge between the finger and thumb, preventing their collapse [@kashlan2011; @kashlan2012; @balchak2018].

<!-- TODO: an image here would be nice -->
Indeed, the Kleyman laboratory has identified short segments of the GRIP domain (eight and eleven amino acids in &alpha; and &gamma;ENaC, respectively) which, when flowed over open channels, close them [@carattino2008; @kashlan2010; @passero2010].[The &alpha; peptide is LPHPLQRL, and RFSHRIPLLIF that of the &gamma; subunit.]{.aside}
These peptides are part of the P1 strand and pack tightly against &alpha;2 of the finger domain.
We have hypothesized that cleavage and subsequent removal of the P3 strand releases P1 and, therefore, decouples the finger and thumb [@noreng20].
From here, we and others have proposed that the gating mechanism is more-or-less that of ASIC: the finger and thumb collapse, and their movement pulls the palm and TMD away from the pore axis.

<!-- TODO: FaNaC image would be nice -->
The new results from FaNaC call this assumption into question [@valeriakalienkova2023].
The finger and thumb do *not* collapse in FaNaC.
Rather, they move in a concerted action up and away from the membrane, toward the &alpha;6 helix of the adjacent knuckle domain.

It is worth noting here that while FaNaC is gated by peptide binding (as is ENaC, after a fashion), FaNaC's ligand binding pocket is distinct from ENaC's.
The FaNaC peptide binds a pocket comprising &alpha;2, the &beta;6-&beta;7 linker, and &alpha;6 from the adjacent subunit, i.e., the finger and knuckle.
ENaC's GRIP domain interacts instead with the thumb and finger.
Since the FaNaC pocket is on "the other side" of the finger, it would not be entirely surprising if the movement of the finger in the two channels is different.

A histidine in the &beta;9-&alpha;4 loop of FaNaC (which connects the palm and thumb) points down between TM1 and TM2.
Mutation of this histidine to serine results in constitutively-active channels, implying that the energy gained by ligand binding is used to overcome the interaction of this histidine with the TMs.
Alignments place bulky residues in this position for both ASIC and ENaC (tryptophan and tyrosine, respectively).

### Conduction &mdash; what we expect for the TMD

As yet, no map  of ENaC has reliable density for the transmembrane domain.
Nevertheless, we can infer a great deal from electrophysiological studies of ENaC and maps of other members of the ENaC/DEG family, mostly the well-studied ASIC.

ASIC's gating cycle comprises three states: resting, open, and desensitized.
The pore of the first solved structure of ASIC was asymmetric, but this truncated crystallization construct did not conduct sodium currents [@jasti07].
Subsequent structures of ASIC show symmetric pores in all three states.

In the resting state of ASIC, negative charges clustered in the acidic pocket (formed by the finger, thumb, and &beta;-ball) hold the finger and thumb apart.
The separation of the thumb from the finger pushes the palm inward, holding the lateral gate closed.

<!-- TODO: an image of the fenestration here would be nice -->
When ASIC encounters low extracellular pH, the residues in the acidic pocket are protonated.
This relieves electrostatic repulsion and allows the finger/thumb interface to collapse, pulling the palm and TMD inward and opening a lateral fenestration just above the membrane [@baconguis2014].
In the open state, the ions pass from the extracellular fenestration down a negatively-charged pore through the GAS belt, and into the intracellular fenestration.
The GAS belt selects for Na^+^ over other cations by a "sieving mechanism", physically preventing the passage of ions with hydrated radii too large for the filter.
It is worth noting here that ENaC's significantly higher Na^+^ selectivity and lower unitary currents suggest that, unlike ASIC, Na^+^ ions are dehydrated before passing through ENaC [@palmer82].
We thus expect that ENaC's selectivity filter will be significantly narrower than that of ASIC [@mahler2012].

<!-- TODO: an image of the GAS belt here would be nice -->
Interestingly, TM2 is split halfway through the membrane, with the C-terminal side swapping to complete the TM2 of the adjacent (clockwise) subunit.[Evolutionary analysis suggests that a non-swapped conformation may have some physiological relevance, but no functional structure of this state has been solved [@kasimova2020].]{.aside}
This domain swap forms a triangular arrangement of short Gly-Ala-Ser loops, called the GAS belt.
The GAS belt forms ASIC's selectivity filter [@carattino2012].
The homologous residues in the &alpha;-, &beta;-, and &gamma;ENaC (GSS, GGS, and SCS respectively) play a significant role in that channel's selectivity, implying the same pore structure and domain swap [@kellenberger1999; @kellenberger1999a].

The conical region below the GAS belt and between TMs was believed to be filled with unstructured lipids.
However, a recent structure of ASIC revealed that the N-terminus briefly re-enters the membrane to buttress the GAS belt [@yoder20].
The re-entrant loop also houses the highly-conserved N-terminal two-residue His-Gly pair (the HG motif).
The HG motif is critically important in gating and selectivity of ENaC, and likely plays a similar role in other ENaC/DEG family members [@chang1996; @grunder1997; @grunder1999].
The HG motif supports the GAS belt through several hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions with adjacent TM2s, stabilizing this otherwise-fragile structure.

Unlike ENaC, ASIC desensitizes.
In desensitized ASICs, the &beta;11-&beta;12 linker in the palm domain is flipped toward the channel center [@baconguis2012].
This decouples the still-collapsed finger and thumb domains from the lower palm and TMD, allowing the fenestration to close.
In essence, the desensitized channels have an open ECD but a closed TMD.
As ENaCs do not desensitize, it remains to be seen whether the &beta;11-&beta;-12 linker plays a role in gating.

### Glycosylation {#sec-intro_glycosylation}

Glycans play an essential role in channel trafficking and maturation.
The &beta; subunit is heavily glycosylated, with eleven predicted sites in human compared to &alpha; and &gamma;'s six and five, respectively.
Prior to this work, four sites on &beta;ENaC, two on &alpha;ENaC, and one on &gamma;ENaC had been modeled [@noreng20].
Deletion of all glycosylation sites on any of the three subunits significantly decreases both total and surface expression of ENaC [@kashlan2018].
The same dependence of expression on glycosylation is seen in ASIC [@kadurin2008].

ENaC glycosylation has functional implications beyond surface expression.
Glycan maturation and proteolytic processing appear to happen in a concerted fashion, but they are not interdependent [@hughey04].
SSI is significantly reduced in ENaCs without glycans on any of the three subunits [@kashlan2018].
ASIC also depends on glycans for proper channel function &mdash; deletion of glycans changes current magnitude or proton affinity [@kadurin2008].

To my knowledge, investigation of ENaC glycosylation has thus far been limited to knock-out of all predicted glycosylation sites in a single subunit or the entire channel.
A study of single-glycan knock-outs, as has been performed in ASIC, would be invaluable in determining the specific contribution of glycosylation of each ECD domain.

## Direct regulation of ENaC

### Proteases {#sec-intro_proteolysis}

Proteolytic activation of ENaC was discovered shortly after the channel itself.
Overnight treatment of *Xenopus laevis* bladder with aprotinin (a serine protease inhibitor) dramatically reduced ENaC currents; the same effect was observed in an *X. laevis* cell line [@orce1980; @vallet1997].
ENaC currents were quickly rescued by treatment with the serine protease trypsin.
Thus, an activating role for proteases was established.

Early ENaC researchers noted multiple distinct populations of ENaC at the cell surface, ranging from the so-called "near-silent" population with a low P~O~ (less than 0.02) to the high P~O~ channels which are essentially constitutively open (P~O~ &cong; 0.9) [@firsov1996; @palmer1996].
Treatment with exogenous trypsin activated the near-silent channels, and ENaC in cells is itself found in cleaved and uncleaved states (making a secondary messenger less likely) [@caldwell2004; @hughey2004].

Prostasin was the first protease found to activate ENaC [@vallet1997].[The ortholog of prostasin in *X. laevis* was discovered before this evolutionary connection was known. Tt is still named Channel Activating Protease 1 (CAP1) in that organism for this reason.]{.aside}
Furin's role in channel activation was reported shortly thereafter [@hughey2004].
Prostasin is a membrane-associate serine protease, expressed highly in prostate and seminal fluid and moderately in other tissues including colon, lung, and kidney [@yu1994].
In contrast to prostasin's relatively circumscribed expression, furin (also a serine protease) is expressed in essentially all human tissues.
Furin plays a role in a vast array of biological processes including ENaC activation and is well-reviewed by Thomas [@thomas2002].

Both furin and prostasin are enteropeptidases which cleave following polybasic tracts (i.e., stretches of amino acids with multiple Lys or Arg residues).
Both &alpha;ENaC and &gamma;ENaC have canonical cleavage sites in their GRIP domains which open the channel (@sec-intro_structure-gating) [@hughey2004].
Unfortunately, these sites are in regions we have not yet been able to model.
The relative changes in P~O~ resulting from each cleavage event is still unclear, and seems to be tissue dependent[@hughey2004; @bruns07; @caldwell2005].
In addition to prostasin, &gamma;ENaC is also cleaved and activated by a wide repertoire of different proteases in different tissues [@adebamiro2007; @garcia-caballero2008; @caldwell2005; @garcia-caballero2011; @haerteis2012; @ji2015; @passero2012; @passero2008; @patel2012; @svenningsen2009; @tan2014].

Removal of the inhibitory peptides is thought to open ENaC by relieving SSI [@sheng06].[Recall that sodium self-inhibition describes the tendency of steady-state ENaC currents to be smaller than peak currents, somewhat resembling desensitization.]{.aside}
Mutagenesis and structural work identified a putative Na^+^-binding "acidic pocket" formed by the finger and &beta;-ball.
If the GRIP domain does indeed prevent collapse of the finger and thumb toward each other, Na^+^ binding to a low-affinity site on the other side of &alpha;1 may pull the finger up and away from the thumb.
Structures demonstrating such movement have yet to be captured &mdash; indeed, all structures solved before this work were in high-Na^+^ buffers.

Proteolytic activation has been described in great detail in a wide range of *in vitro* systems, but the link is not quite so obvious *in vivo*.
For instance, mice treated with aprotinin show reduced ENaC activity as expected [@bohnert2018].
However, when mice are fed a low-sodium diet, the appearance of cleaved ENaC and increases in amiloride-sensitive current are largely independent [@frindt2018].
It is thus not obvious that the direct cleavage/current relationship observed *in vitro* is true *in vivo*.
What's more, while proteolytic cleavage may be the main pathway by which ENaC is opened, ENaC is also sensitive to other signals.

### The membrane {#sec-intro-membrane}

#### Phospholipids {#sec-intro-phospholipids}

Like many ion channels, ENaC is modulated by phospholipids.
For instance, ENaC is known to segregate into lipid rafts [@hill02; @hill07].[Lipid rafts are proposed regions of the cell membrane enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids. While there is clearly some kind of spatial-compositional heterogeneity in cell membranes, the existence of lipid rafts in particular is still an open question [@shaw2006; @hill07].]{.aside}
Cholesterol alone does not activate the channel, but it does facilitate the interaction between phosphatidylinositol and binding sites in the &beta; and &gamma; subunits [@archer2020; @zhai19].
This interaction is absolutely required for ENaC opening.

Treatment of inside-out patches with phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP~2~) increases ENaC P~O~ within seconds, and P~O~ is reduced again upon PIP~2~ removal, ruling out the possibility of PIP~2~-induced proteolytic cleavage [@ma2002; @pochynyuk2006].
Similarly, no change in channel number is observed in these experiments PIP~2~.
A similar dependence of ENaC current on PIP~2~ levels is observed in mouse trachea [@kunzelmann2005].
Note that more PIP~2~ than is necessary does not result in greater ENaC currents --- that is, a lack of PIP~2~ reduces ENaC currents but PIP~2~ does not itself potentiate them [@markadieu2004].

Unlike PIP~2~, phosphatidylinositol triphosphate (PIP~3~) does augment ENaC currents both directly and via a signaling cascade.
In its immediate effect, PIP~3~ binds &gamma;ENaC just after the second transmembrane domain to rapidly open the channel [@markadieu2004; @tong2004b; @pochynyuk2005].[Interestingly, mutation of negatively-charged residues in the &gamma;ENaC PIP~3~ binding site increases ENaC currents both with *and* without PIP~3~ [@pochynyuk2005].]{.aside}
PIP~3~ also increases the number of channels at the cell surface in a longer cascade mediated by SGK (@sec-intro_sgk) [@paunescu2000].
In fact, aldosterone's effect on SGK is mediated by PI3K and PIP~3~ [@tong2004a].

ENaC's dependence on phosphatidylinositols presents a problem.
PIPs are rare enough in the membrane that, if the lipids and channel were both freely diffusing, the expected P~O~ of ENaC would be far lower than what is observed [@ingolfsson2014; @bao2014].
MARCKS is a lipid-binding protein which sequesters PIP~2~ and PIP~3~ into regions of high local concentration [@wang2002].
MARCKS also binds ENaC, potentially anchoring the channel in a region of the membrane with a high enough local concentration PIPs for the proper channel P~O~ [@alli2012].[MARCKS is itself subject to regulation by a wide range of signals, which in turn affect ENaC currents, e.g., Ca^2+^ and (in an amusing symmetry) proteolysis of MARCKS itself [@alli2015; @montgomery2017].]{.aside}

#### Palmitoylation

Palmitoylation is a reversible process in which hydrophobic chains are attached to cysteine residues, anchoring them in the membrane.
Multiple cysteines in &beta;- and &gamma;ENaC are palmitoylated (but none in &alpha;ENaC), with varying effects [@mueller10; @mueller12; @mukherjee14].

Blocking palmitoylation of two cysteines in &beta;ENaC (in mouse: C43 and C557) significantly reduces ENaC currents [@mueller10].
This effect is not mediated by differences in trafficking or cleavage but by changes in channel P~O~, specifically increased SSI.
C43 is suggestively close to the HG motif; it may be that membrane anchoring of this cysteine aids in proper folding of the re-entrant loop and therefore the pore.
This conjecture is supported by the observation in the same study that C557A mutants have significantly increased unitary conductance.

&gamma;ENaC also has two palmitoylated cysteines, C33 and C41, which straddle that subunit's HG motif [@mukherjee14].
Again, C&rarr;A mutation of these cysteines increase SSI without affecting surface exposure or channel cleavage.
Surprisingly, addition of a &beta; palmitoylation mutant to a mutant &gamma; background does not further reduce currents --- put another way, the &gamma; mutations are dominant.

### Mechanosensation {#sec-intro_mechano}

Whether ENaC is mechanosensitive or not has long been a point of contention, but decades of careful research indicate that laminar sheer stress (LSS) opens the channel regardless of proteolytic state.
Bath perfusion of *X. laevis* oocytes or CHO cells expressing ENaC produces amiloride-sensitive Na^+^ currents [@satlin2001; @karpushev2010].
Single channel recordings indicate that LSS currents result from increased P~O~ [@althaus2007].
Although LSS can open uncleaved channels, pre-treatment of human ENaC with trypsin significantly primed LSS response [@althaus2007; @fronius2010].[The same study reported an opposite effect &mdash; inhibition of LSS currents by trypsin treatment &mdash; for *X. laevis* ENaC [@althaus2007].]{.aside}
Over the course of minutes, ENaC becomes less sensitive to repeated stimulation with LSS [@carattino2004].
Mutant ENaCs with truncated C-termini did not show this response, indicating that it may be mediated by Nedd4-2 (@sec-intro_nedd42-enac).

Multiple domains may participate in LSS sensation.
Genetic deletion of the GRIP domain slows response to LSS, although this may be an artifact of differences in finger/thumb coupling rather than a true measure of the GRIP domain's participation in gating [@shi2012].
Work on human and rat ENaC demonstrated a strong dependence of LSS currents on glycosylation of the &alpha;ENaC palm and knuckle; in another study, no such deletion of any single subunit's glycans has no effect on LSS currents [@knoepp2020; @kashlan2018].
The former study makes a compelling argument that the glycans influence LSS by interacting with the extracellular matrix &mdash; a difference in oocyte preparation may therefore explain this discrepancy.
