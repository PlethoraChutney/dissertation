# ENaC in the Body

ENaC is a highly-specific triheteromeric sodium channel expressed throughout the human body.
The channel comprises one copy each of the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits.
ENaC is thought to be activated by proteolytic removal of a portion of its extracellular domain, and is potently inhibited by a small molecule called amiloride and its derivatives.
<!-- TODO: ENaC mechanism crossref --> delves more deeply into the suspected molecular mechanism of ENaC and the source of its selectivity.
However, I will begin with a background in the function of the channel, especially as it relates to human health.
I will begin with the system in which ENaC's function is best understood, the kidney.
Next I will cover the channel's role in controlling the thickness of the airway mucosal layer.
Finally, I will cover less-studied domains of ENaC expression &mdash; namely, the tongue, heart, and colon.

## ENaC in the kidney

Blood pressure must be maintained within a narrow window of acceptable values.
Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but too high and blood vessels sustain damage.
It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescale [@guyton1991].
ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion.

When the kidney is not receiving enough salt, it initiates a cascade which ends with the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone augmenting the activity of ENaC in the distal nephron (@fig-intro_kidney-reg).
Apical sodium permeability is increased both by synthesis of new channels as well as trafficking of an existing pool of channels to the cell surface [@asher1996; @frindt09].[Of note: Asher and colleagues report an aldosterone mediated increase in expression of the &beta; and &gamma;, but not &alpha;, subunits. A trend of subunit-specific regulation is widely observed in the literature, but poorly understood.]{.aside}
Despite its expression relatively late in the nephron, ENaC is the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption in the kidney.
<!-- TODO: need citation here -->
Sodium in the principal cells is transported across the basolateral membrane by the Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase, and therefore induces retention of extra water to maintain the tightly-controlled plasma sodium level.
Thus, ENaC controls three essential functions of kidney filtration: first, the amount of sodium reabsorbed by the kidney; second, blood volume (and therefore pressure); third, the amount of potassium passed from the plasma into the urine.

A variety of ENaC mutations have dramatic effects on patients' blood pressure.
One of the earliest described is Liddle syndrome [@liddle63].
Liddle syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism) results from an autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation in ENaC.
Severe hypertension, low potassium, high blood pH, low renin activity, and low aldosterone are hallmarks of the disease [@hanukoglu16].
It is a rare disorder, with only 72 families described as of 2018 [@tetti2018].
However, after excluding patients with other clear causes (primary aldosteronism, kidney or heart diseases, and obstructive sleep apnea), approximately one in one hundred hypertensive patients had Liddle syndrome, indicating that the prevalence may be higher than is currently thought [@wang2015; @liu2018].
All but one of the described cases involve mutation of the &beta; or &gamma; subunits [@tetti2018; @liu2018].

A majority of the mutations in the &beta; and &gamma; subunits disrupt or remove entirely a proline-rich PY motif at the C-terminus of those channels [@yang2014].
This PY motif is the binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 (see section <!-- TODO: crossref nedd4-2 section -->).
Study of ENaC surface dwell time is complicated by a reserve pool maintained by the cells to be cycled up to the membrane, but there is a consensus that ENaC is recycled quickly; surface half life estimates range from fifteen minutes to three hours, with the low end having more support [@butterworth2009].
ENaC lacking the PY motif cannot be pulled back in from the membrane, thus increasing sodium permeability by increasing *N* rather than the conductivity or P~O~ of the channels [@schild1995; @abriel1999; @lu2007].The &alpha; subunit does have a PY motif, but no Liddle syndrome mutation of the &alpha; PY has been described. This is discussed further in <!-- TODO: crossref nedd4-2 section -->]{.aside}
The remaining minority of described Liddle syndrome mutations (including the sole ENaC~&alpha;~ mutation) which do not affect PY-motif binding instead directly augment channel P~O~ [@tetti2018].
Liddle syndrome is typically treated with small molecules that block ENaC (amiloride or triamterene) and a low-salt diet.

Loss-of-function mutations also cause severe phenotypes.
Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) was first described in a severely dehydrated infant who did not respond to aldosterone treatment [@cheek1958].
There are two forms of PHA1: renal PHA1, which is milder and involves a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor; and systemic PHA1, which involves a mutation in a gene for ENaC &alpha;, &beta;, or &gamma; [@geller1998; @chang1996].
Patients with systemic PHA1 are unable to retain any salt, and so become severely dehydrated and have high potassium, low sodium, and increased acidity in their blood [@hanukoglu16].
This makes the disease particularly deadly to newborns, and requires life-long supplementation with sodium and the potassium elimination drug Kayexalate [@edelheit2005].
Contrary to the pattern observed for Liddle Syndrome, most systemic PHA1 mutations occur in the gene encoding ENaC~&alpha;~ [@edelheit2005].[Although the genes for the &beta; and &gamma; subunits are both on chromosome 16 and the gene for ENaC~&alpha;~ is on chromosome 12, no difference in the rates of mutation for the affected genes are seen between patients and control groups [@edelheit2005].]{.aside}
The majority of described PHA1 mutations are nonsense mutations, although three missense mutations have been described [@chang1996; @schaedel1999; @edelheit2005].
One of these mutations occurs in the palm domain, one in the transmembrane domain, and one likely in the intracellular domain.

## ENaC in the lung

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disorder which affects many organs, but most prominently the lungs.
Patients with CF have thick airway mucus they are unable to clear, causing chronic airway infections and lung damage.
Patients with CF also lose salt but, unlike patients with PHA1, the causative mutation is in the *CFTR* gene rather than an ENaC gene.

*CFTR* encodes a chloride channel (CFTR) which transports chloride and bicarbonate across epithelia.
In the lung, this chloride transport is balanced by sodium uptake via ENaC, which in turn regulates the thickness of the airway surface liquid (ASL) [@randell2006].
Defective CFTR increases the absorption of sodium, dehydrating and thickening the ASL.
Mice which overexpress &beta;ENaC in the airway show CF-like symptoms, including reduced airway liquid height and mucous clearance [@mall2004].[Interestingly, mice overexpressing the &alpha; or &gamma; subunits did not show CF-like symptoms. The authors point to prior research showing that &alpha;&beta;-only channels have a higher P~O~ than &alpha;&beta;&gamma; [@fyfe1998].]{.aside}
