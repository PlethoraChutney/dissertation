# ENaC in the Body



## ENaC in the kidney

Blood pressure must be maintained within a narrow window of acceptable values.
Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but blood vessels sustain damage when pressure is too high.
It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescale [@guyton91].
ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion.

When the kidney is not receiving enough salt (which could be a result of a low-salt diet or reduced blood pressure), it initiates a cascade which ends with the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone augmenting the activity of ENaC in the distal nephron.
Apical sodium permeability is increased both by synthesis of new channels as well as trafficking of an existing pool of channels to the cell surface [@asher1996; @frindt09].[Of note: Asher and colleagues report an aldosterone-mediated increase in expression of the &beta; and &gamma;, but not &alpha;, subunits. A trend of subunit-specific regulation is widely observed in the literature.]{.aside}
