# ENaC in the Body

ENaC is a highly-specific triheteromeric sodium channel expressed throughout the human body.
The channel comprises one copy each of the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits.
ENaC is thought to be activated by proteolytic removal of a portion of its extracellular domain, and is potently inhibited by a small molecule called amiloride and its derivatives.
<!-- TODO: ENaC mechanism crossref --> delves more deeply into the suspected molecular mechanism of ENaC and the source of its selectivity.
However, I will begin with a background in the function of the channel, especially as it relates to human health.
I will begin with ENaC's regulation of blood pressure from the kidney, function and tissue in which it is best understood.
Next I will cover the channel's role in controlling the thickness of the airway surface mucosal layer, which seems to be a major component in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.
I then briefly cover a few interesting but less-studied domains of ENaC expression &mdash; namely, taste buds, blood vessels, and colon.
Finally, I provide an overview of specific proteins and processes known to regulate ENaC.

## ENaC in the kidney

Blood pressure must be maintained within a narrow window of acceptable values.
Too low, and vital organs do not receive sufficient oxygen and nutrients to function, but too high and blood vessels sustain damage.
It is not surprising, then, that the human body has evolved several mechanisms for responding to changes in blood pressure, each with their own timescale [@guyton1991].
ENaC is the essential mechanism of the longest-term control, kidney excretion.

![Simplified model of ENaC regulation in a principal cell of the distal nephron in the kidney.](figures/kidney-cartoon/kidney-cartoon.png){#fig-intro_kidney-reg}

When the kidney is not receiving enough salt, it initiates a cascade which ends with the mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone augmenting the activity of ENaC in the distal nephron (@fig-intro_kidney-reg).
Apical sodium permeability is increased both by synthesis of new channels as well as trafficking of an existing pool of channels to the cell surface [@asher1996; @frindt09].[Of note: Asher and colleagues report an aldosterone mediated increase in expression of the &beta; and &gamma;, but not &alpha;, subunits. A trend of subunit-specific regulation is widely observed in the literature, but poorly understood.]{.aside}
Despite its expression relatively late in the nephron, ENaC is the rate-limiting step of sodium reabsorption in the kidney.
<!-- TODO: need citation here -->
Sodium in the principal cells is transported across the basolateral membrane by the Na^+^/K^+^ ATPase, and therefore induces retention of extra water to maintain the tightly-controlled plasma sodium level.
Thus, ENaC controls three essential functions of kidney filtration: first, the amount of sodium reabsorbed by the kidney; second, blood volume (and therefore pressure); third, the amount of potassium passed from the plasma into the urine.

A variety of ENaC mutations have dramatic effects on patients' blood pressure.
One of the earliest described is Liddle syndrome [@liddle63].
Liddle syndrome (also called pseudoaldosteronism) results from an autosomal dominant gain-of-function mutation in ENaC.
Severe hypertension, low potassium, high blood pH, low renin activity, and low aldosterone are hallmarks of the disease [@hanukoglu16].
It is a rare disorder, with only 72 families described as of 2018 [@tetti2018].
However, after excluding patients with other clear causes (primary aldosteronism, kidney or heart diseases, and obstructive sleep apnea), approximately one in one hundred hypertensive patients had Liddle syndrome, indicating that the prevalence may be higher than is currently thought [@wang2015; @liu2018].
All but one of the described cases involve mutation of the &beta; or &gamma; subunits [@tetti2018; @liu2018].

A majority of the mutations in the &beta; and &gamma; subunits disrupt or remove entirely a proline-rich PY motif at the C-terminus of those channels [@yang2014].
This PY motif is the binding site for the E3 ubiquitin ligase NEDD4-2 (see section <!-- TODO: crossref NEDD4-2 section -->).
Study of ENaC surface dwell time is complicated by a reserve pool maintained by the cells to be cycled up to the membrane, but there is a consensus that ENaC is recycled quickly; surface half life estimates range from fifteen minutes to three hours, with the low end having more support [@butterworth2009].
ENaC lacking the PY motif cannot be pulled back in from the membrane, thus increasing sodium permeability by increasing *N* rather than the conductivity or P~O~ of the channels [@schild1995; @abriel1999; @lu2007].[The &alpha; subunit does have a PY motif, but no Liddle syndrome mutation of the &alpha; PY has been described. This is discussed further in <!-- TODO: crossref NEDD4-2 section -->]{.aside}
The remaining minority of described Liddle syndrome mutations (including the sole ENaC~&alpha;~ mutation) which do not affect PY-motif binding instead directly augment channel P~O~ [@tetti2018].
Liddle syndrome is typically treated with small molecules that block ENaC (amiloride or triamterene) and a low-salt diet.

Loss-of-function mutations also cause severe phenotypes.
Type 1 pseudohypoaldosteronism (PHA1) was first described in a severely dehydrated infant who did not respond to aldosterone treatment [@cheek1958].
There are two forms of PHA1: renal PHA1, which is milder and involves a mutation in the mineralocorticoid receptor; and systemic PHA1, which involves a mutation in a gene for ENaC &alpha;, &beta;, or &gamma; [@geller1998; @chang1996].
Patients with systemic PHA1 are unable to retain any salt, and so become severely dehydrated and have high potassium, low sodium, and increased acidity in their blood [@hanukoglu16].
This makes the disease particularly deadly to newborns, and requires life-long supplementation with sodium and the potassium elimination drug Kayexalate [@edelheit2005].
Contrary to the pattern observed for Liddle Syndrome, most systemic PHA1 mutations occur in the gene encoding ENaC~&alpha;~ [@edelheit2005].[Although the genes for the &beta; and &gamma; subunits are both on chromosome 16 and the gene for ENaC~&alpha;~ is on chromosome 12, no difference in the rates of mutation for the affected genes are seen between patients and control groups [@edelheit2005].]{.aside}
The majority of described PHA1 mutations are nonsense mutations, although three missense mutations have been described [@chang1996; @schaedel1999; @edelheit2005].
One of these mutations occurs in the palm domain, one in the transmembrane domain, and one likely in the intracellular domain.

## ENaC in the lung

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive genetic disorder which affects many organs, but most prominently the lungs.
Patients with CF have thick airway mucus they are unable to clear, causing chronic airway infections and lung damage.
Patients with CF also lose salt but, unlike patients with PHA1, the causative mutation is in the *CFTR* gene rather than an ENaC gene.

*CFTR* encodes a cAMP-regulated chloride channel, CFTR [@riordan1989].
Pathogenic CFTR mutations dramatically reduce chloride permeability, resulting in poor reabsorption of NaCl [@quinton1983].
In the lung, this chloride secretion is balanced by sodium uptake via ENaC, which in turn regulates the thickness of the airway surface liquid (ASL) [@zabner1998].
Reduced chloride absorption due to mutant CFTR increases the absorption of sodium.
This, in turn, dehydrates and thickens the ASL, which damages the underlying tissue and prevents mucous clearance [@randell2006; @button2012].

The interplay between CFTR and ENaC in CF patients is complicated and not fully understood.
Treatment of normal, but not CF, lung epithelia with amiloride augments Cl^-^ transport [@knowles1983].
Cells co-expressing CFTR and ENaC show smaller ENaC currents than do cells expressing only ENaC, but this effect depends both CFTR's ability to pass Cl^-^ and ENaC's intracellular termini [@ji2000].
Mice which overexpress &beta;ENaC in the airway show CF-like symptoms, including reduced airway liquid height and mucous clearance [@mall2004].[Interestingly, mice overexpressing the &alpha; or &gamma; subunits did not show CF-like symptoms. The authors point to prior research showing that &alpha;&beta;-only channels have a higher P~O~ than &alpha;&beta;&gamma; [@fyfe1998].]{.aside}
It seems, then, that the function of the two ion channels is linked both by electrochemical gradients and potentially other regulatory partners.

The picture turns out not to be quite so neat.
Double-mutant mice which overexpress &beta;ENaC and CFTR have normal Cl^-^ secretion but neither a concomitant decrease in Na^+^ absorption nor a rescue of the CF-like phenotype [@grubb2012].
Additionally, Liddle syndrome patients have increased sodium absorption throughout their body but neither they nor Liddle syndrome mice develop lung disease [@mall2010].
Human patients with *reduced* &beta;ENaC function develop CF-like phenotypes of lung infection and elevated sweat chloride, but PHA1 patients produce excessive airway liquid without infection [@sheridan2005; @kerem1999].
There are many hypothesis as to how these contradictions may be resolved, reviewed well by Collawn and colleagues, but more work on the subject is desperately needed [@collawn2012].
One important point is that the mouse model does not recapitulate human disease well.
Indeed, mice with CFTR mutations which are pathogenic in humans do not develop lung disease at all [@grubb1999].

## ENaC in the tongue

As one might expect for a sodium-specific ion channel, ENaC is also implicated in taste.
Although it may seem a less clinically-essential tissue, ENaC function and expression in the tongue differs significantly from what is expected based on the better-studied kidney.
It is therefore useful as a spotlight on how little we still know about the very basic stoichiometry and function of the ENaC subunits.

The organization of taste in the mammalian tongue is complex, but well-reviewed by Yarmolinsnky and colleagues [@yarmolinsky2009].
Briefly, taste buds comprise 50&ndash;100 taste receptor cells (TRCs).
Each TRC expresses receptors for and responds to just one of the five basic tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, and umami [@zhao2003; @chandrashekar2006].
These receptors are highly diverse, with closely-related species having widely varying taste responses to the same molecule.[For instance, hamsters do not taste aspartame as sweet [@danilova1998].]{.aside}

Salt sensation is further divided into an appetitive taste (a potato chip) and an aversive taste (sea water).
Amiloride blocks rats' ability to taste the difference between KCl and NaCl and reduces their voluntary NaCl (but not KCl) consumption [@spector1996; @gannon1995].
Thus, the appetitive taste is taken to result from Na^+^ currents in amiloride-sensitive TRCs, while the aversive NaCl taste results from Cl^-^ currents in amiloride-insensitive TRCs [@roebber2019].
ENaC seems a prime candidate for the amiloride-sensitive Na^+^ current; indeed all three subunits are detected in taste buds but not the surrounding epithelia [@kretz1999].
Mice with &alpha;ENaC specifically knocked-out in mature TRCs lost their preference for salt, and those TRCs no longer responded to low Na^+^ concentrations [@chandrashekar2010].
However, recent work has significantly complicated the role of &alpha;&beta;&gamma; ENaC in salt taste.

Investigation of ENaC expression patterns in mouse taste buds show that no taste bud cell expresses both the &alpha; and &beta; subunits[@lossow2020].
This result is further complicated by the fact that amiloride-sensitive salt perception depends on the mouse line, and the line used in the expression pattern study has a low amiloride sensitivity [@shigemura2008].
Thus the possibility remains that salt taste in mice is mediated by &alpha;&beta;&gamma;ENaC and is simply harder to detect with this experimental setup.
However, as discussed further in section <!-- TODO: reference stoichiometry section -->, &alpha;ENaC is sufficient to form small (100 times smaller than &alpha;&beta;&gamma;) currents when expressed alone in oocytes [@canessa1994].
Homomeric &alpha; channels may instead carry the amiloride-sensitive salt taste.
Perhaps more importantly, salt taste in humans is insensitive to amiloride [@desor1989].
Additionally, humans express &delta;ENaC (a fourth subunit which is a pseudogene in rats and mice) in the taste bud, rather than &alpha;ENaC [@stahler2008].

The mouse model of taste, much like that of cystic fibrosis, seems to be a poor facsimile of the process in humans.
Despite this fact, salty taste illustrates an important unanswered question regarding ENaC: what is the full compliment of physiologically-relevant functional ENaC channels?
As covered in <!-- TODO: reference stoichiometry section -->, the two canonical channels comprise one each of the &beta;, &gamma;, and either &alpha; or &delta; subunits.
However, the combination of &alpha;ENaC knock-out mice and ENaC expression patterns makes it apparent that channels with only a single ENaC subunit, while rare, are physiologically relevant.
I note here that we cannot say these channels are homomeric &alpha;ENaC channels.
They may be assemblies of ENaC with other ENaC/DEG family members or as-yet unknown other proteins.
Regardless of the ultimate identity of the amiloride-sensitive salt taste receptor, the patterns observed in taste are difficult to explain if the only physiologically relevant ENaC is the &alpha;/&delta;&beta;&gamma; triheteromer, which makes it an interesting and valuable system for further study.

## ENaC in Other Tissues

### Blood vessels

Myogenic vasoconstriction is an important component of blood pressure regulation in which the diameter of a blood vessel decreases in response to increased blood pressure.
This response is essential for maintaining proper blood flow.
ENaC is expressed in the vascular smooth muscle cells responsible for the constriction of blood vessels [@drummond2004; @althaus2007].[Not to belabor an earlier point, but only &beta; and &gamma; ENaC are detected in *ex vivo* preparations of vascular smooth muscle cells, while those subunits plus &alpha; are detected in cultured cells.]{.aside}
Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives reduces myogenic tone in a dose-dependent manner.
This fact, combined with the knowledge that ENaC relatives are mechanosensitive in worms makes ENaC a likely candidate for the pressure sensor responsible for myogenic vasoconstriction [@gu1996].

Similarly, systemic blood pressure is monitored by the central nervous system via baroreceptors.
Baroreceptors keep mean arterial pressure at a steady level on a short time scale [@kougias2010].
These neurons express &beta; and &gamma;, but not &alpha;, ENaC [@drummond1998].
Treatment with amiloride or its derivatives blocks both the response of these neurons to physical stimulation and blood pressure regulation.
It therefore seems likely that ENaC is used by baroreceptors to sense blood pressure, but further research is necessary to strictly define this role.

### Colon

ENaC plays an important role in sodium reabsorption in the colon.
Colon expression of &beta; and &gamma;, but not &alpha;, ENaC increases response to aldosterone treatment [@epple2000; @bertog2008].
Patients with Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory bowl disease, have reduced sodium reabsorption in the colon, which leads to diarrhea [@sandle1990; @zeissig2008].
Similarly, patients with ulcerative colitis have diarrhea due to inhibition of ENaC expression by inflammatory cytokines [@amasheh2004].
To be clear, the colon relies on a wide array of systems to reabsorb ions and water.
These results indicate that ENaC is one of the players in this process.

## Regulation {#sec-regulation}

It should come as no surprise that expression of ENaC is under tight control, given the number of important processes ENaC is implicated in.
This overview of ENaC regulation is necessarily brief and focuses on regulation in the kidney (@fig-intro_kidney-reg), since that system is best understood.
The patterns observed in the kidney largely hold in other tissues, with the notable exception of gene expression response to aldosterone.

In aldosterone-responsive tissues, aldosterone binds the mineralocorticoid receptor and induces expression of ENaC subunits.
The exact amount of increase for each subunit varies tissue to tissue.
