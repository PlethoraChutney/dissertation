# Glossary {.unnumbered}

14-3-3
: a protein which binds and inhibits phosphorylated proteins, including *Nedd4*.

ACMA
: a fluorescent dye. When ACMA intercalates into a lipid bilayer, it is quenched by a pH gradient across that bilayer.

ASIC
: the Acid Sensing Ion Channel family. A well-studied member of the ENaC/DEG superfamily opened by low extracellular pH. In this document, I use ASIC to refer to ASIC1 unless specified.

ASL
: airway surface liquid, a layer of mucous which protects the lung.

Acidic Pocket
: unfortunately, this name is used to refer to two separate things in the literature. In ASIC, the acidic pocket is between the finger and thumb; the channel opens when the acidic pocket is protonated. In ENaC, the acidic pocket comprises residues from the finger and &beta;-ball and is thought to be involved in *sodium self-inhibition*.

Aldosterone
: a mineralocorticoid hormone essential for regulation of blood pressure and plasma sodium and potassium levels.

Amiloride
: a small molecule which blocks ENaC/DEG superfamily ion channels. ENaC binds amiloride several orders of magnitude tighter than other members of the ENaC/DEG superfamily.

Benzamil
: a derivative of *amiloride* with a higher affinity for ENaC.

C2 domain
: a lipid- and protein-binding domain.

CCCP
: a proton ionophore

CF
: cystic fibrosis.

CKO
: an ENaC construct with intracellular cysteines knocked out. See @tbl-human-constructs for more information.

CKO/DEG
: *CKO* ENaC with additional mutations to bias the channel toward the open state. See @tbl-human-constructs for more information.

DDM
: n-dodecyl-&beta;-D-maltoside, a detergent commonly used to solubilize membrane proteins.

DM
: n-decyl-&beta;-D-maltoside, a detergent commonly used to solubilize membrane proteins.

ECD
: the extracellular domain, comprising the palm, knuckle, finger, GRIP, &beta;-ball, and thumb domains.

ENaC
: the Epithelial Sodium Channel.

FaNaC
: the FMRFamide peptideâ€“activated sodium channel family. A member of the ENaC/DEG superfamily found only in mollusks and gated by a small peptide.

Fab
: the antigen-binding portion of an antibody.

GAS belt
: a domain swapping loop of TM2 observed in most ASIC structures to date. In ASIC, the GAS belt comprises a Gly-Ala-Ser triad which forms the selectivity filter.

GRIP domain
: the Gating Relief of Inhibition by Proteolysis domain. Wedged between the finger and the thumb, when this domain is cleaved by proteases in the &alpha; and &gamma; subunits, the channel opens.

HECT domain
: the domain of a *HECT ligase* responsible for transferring a ubiquitin molecule from an E2 ligase to the substrate.

HECT ligase
: a family of E3 ligases. Most HECT ligases discussed in this work comprise a *C2 domain*, a number of *WW domains*, and a *HECT domain*.

HG motif
: a highly-conserved His-Gly pair which is essential for proper function of ENaC. In ASIC, the HG motif is found in a re-entrant loop which buttresses the GAS belt

I
: current. Often used to refer to currents of a specific ion, e.g., I~Na^+^~ for sodium current.

IC~50~
: concentration of an inhibitor at which the inhibited process is at 50% of its uninhibited value.

Macroscopic current
: the current recorded from an entire expression system, e.g., a whole-cell current; cf. *unitary current*.

N
: the number of ion channels at the surface of a cell

NP~O~
: *N* times *P~O~* (the number of channels times their open probability). Essentially the *macroscopic current* divided by the *unitary current*.

Nedd4
: a family of HECT ligases, including the eponymous Nedd4 and Nedd4-2 (also referred to as Nedd4L)

Open probability
: The proportion of time that a given channel spends in the open state.

PHA
: pseudohypoaldosteronism. In this text, I discuss only type 1 PHA (PHA1), in which the patient has high plasma potassium and low plasma sodium but normal circulating aldosterone levels.

PIP
: phosphatidyl inositol, a phospholipid. Most often found in as a triphosphate (PIP~3~ or PI3P) or bisphosphate (PIP~2~ or PI2P).

PY motif
: a motif following the form PPXY which is bound by WW domains.

Phenamil
: a derivative of *amiloride* with a higher affinity for ENaC.

P~O~
: see *open probability*.

SGK
: Serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase, a serine/threonine kinase with a multitude of roles in cell signaling.

SSI
: see *sodium self-inhibition*.

Sodium self-inhibition
: The process by which high extracellular sodium concentrations decrease ENaC currents.

Styrene-Maleic Acid
: a copolymer used to directly solubilize a membrane into nanodiscs of native lipids

TM
: a transmembrane helix, usually followed by a number (e.g., TM1)

TMD
: the transmembrane domain, comprising both TMs from all three subunits (six helices total).

TRC
: taste receptor cells. These cells express channels which respond to a single one of the five basic tastes: salty, sweet, sour, bitter, or umami.

Unitary current
: currents observed through a single channel; cf. *macroscopic current*.

Valinomycin
: a potassium ionophore

WT
: wild-type; a construct which is identical to (or as close as is feasible) to the sequence one would find in the organism.

WW domain
: a protein-protein interaction domain. WW domains bind *PY motifs*.
