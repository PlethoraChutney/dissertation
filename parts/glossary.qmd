# Glossary {.unnumbered}

ASIC
: the Acid Sensing Ion Channel. A well-studied member of the ENaC/DEG family opened by low extracellular pH.

ENaC
: the Epithelial Sodium Channel.

FaNaC
: the FMRFamide peptideâ€“activated sodium channel. A member of the ENaC/DEG family found only in mollusks and gated by a small peptide.

GRIP domain
: the Gating Relief of Inhibition by Proteolysis domain. Wedged between the finger and the thumb, when this domain is cleaved by proteases in the &alpha; and &gamma; subunits, the channel opens.

Open probability
: The proportion of time that a given channel spends in the open state.

P~O~
: see open probability.

SSI
: see sodium self-inhibition.

Sodium self-inhibition
: The process by which high extracellular sodium concentrations decrease ENaC currents.
