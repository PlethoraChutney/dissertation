# ENaC - An Overview {.unnumbered}

Structural biology is interested in particular domains and residues, but is most interesting in the context of physiological processes.
As such, it can be difficult to order the chapters of an introduction.
Placing the structure before the function grounds discussion of mutations and disease, but leaves the structure unmoored from biomedical relevance.
Conversely, placing function first leaves the reader without a clear understanding of which domains are important for which reasons, which is vital for a focused discussion of the protein.

To dodge the question of which is the cart and which is the course, I present here an exceedingly brief (and less heavily cited) discussion of ENaC structure and function.
Everything covered here is covered in more detail in the Introduction.
ENaC biology is discussed in @sec-intro_physiology, while details on the ENaC/DEG family and ENaC structure can be found in @sec-intro_as-a-channel.

## The ENaC/DEG family

The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is, perhaps obviously, a member of the ENaC/DEG family of ion channels.
These channels are trimeric, pass cationic currents, are voltage-insensitive, and are inhibited by the small molecule amiloride (and its derivatives).
The overall topology of these channels is similar, with the greatest sequence (and, presumably, structural) diversity found in the distal ECD (furthest from the membrane).
Current structural study suggests a conserved overall gating mechanism as well.

Aside from ENaC, the best-studied members of the ENaC/DEG family are the eponymous degenerin (DEG) channel and the acid-sensing ion channel, ASIC.
DEG is expressed in *C. elegans* and is involved in mechanosensation.
ASIC is expressed in a variety of organisms (including humans) and opens in response to acidic extracellular conditions.
ASIC has by far the best-described structure of the family.


## ENaC Structure

![An overview of ENaC structure.](parts/introduction/figures/domain-cartoon/enac-overview.png)

ENaC is a triheteromeric ion channel comprising three subunits, the &alpha;, &beta;, and &gamma; subunits.[For most figures in this document, I color the &alpha; subunit blue, the &beta; subunit red, and the &gamma; subunit magenta.]{.aside}
Each subunit shares an overall similar topology, and so I describe them here without reference to a specific one.

The transmembrane domain, or **TMD**, contains the pore and selectivity filter.
The extracellular domain, or **ECD**, contains domains important for regulating open probability (P~O~) and other functional characteristics.
There are also short intracellular N- and C-terminal tails which regulate surface expression.

The ECD is further subdivided into six domains, named after the parts of a hand.
The **palm** and **&beta;-ball** form a rigid backbone and make the plurality of the contacts with the other subunits.
The **knuckle**, **finger**, and **thumb** likely move during channel gating and contain important glycosylation sites.

The **GRIP** domain is unique to ENaC.
ENaC opens when the GRIP domain is excised from the channel.
The canonical proteases responsible for channel opening are: furin, which cuts the &alpha; subunit twice and &gamma; subunit once; and prostasin, which cuts the &gamma; subunit again.

![An exaggerated model of ENaC opening. **Left**: an uncleaved subunit. **Right**: after GRIP is removed from the channel, the finger and thumb collapse together, pulling the TMD away from the pore axis and opening a fenestration.](figures/other/opening-model.png)

Removal of the GRIP domain is thought to allow the finger and thumb to collapse together.
This movement is coordinated with movement of the palm away from the pore axis, which in turn opens a fenestration just above the membrane.
Ions enter at this fenestration and pass down a pore formed by the second transmembrane helix, TM2.

Along this pore, ions larger than sodium are filtered out by size.
It is thought that this selectivity filter is formed by a three-residue loop connecting swapped domains of TM2, but an un-swapped conformation is also possible.

The above summary of ENaC's presumed gating mechanism is based largely off cross-linking electrophysiology studies and ASIC's well-described gating mechanism.
In ASIC, protons allow for finger/thumb collapse (recall that ASIC does not have a GRIP domain).
However, ASIC rapidly desensitizes and ENaC does not.
